# Monize
> [!CAUTION] 
> This project is 100% written by AI. I've done practically zero manual changes. I am not a programmer by trade, but have dabbled in various languages over the years. This gives me high-level awareness on coding practices, but **I AM NOT SKILLED IN THE LANGUAGES USED IN THIS PRODUCT**. I have spent months prompting Claude Code for features, updates, fixes and tweaks. I have taken steps to ensure this is secure as it can be, given the constraints. I've performed numerous security audits (both AI-prompted and 3rd party) and have implemented best-practice security measures as much as I can (including 2FA and OIDC support). Every build must pass NPM audits and security scans before publishing. However, I can't personally guarantee the security of this code. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**.

## Why This Exists?
The personal finance ecosystem is flooded with personal finance platforms. I've tried many of them, but every single one of them had deal-breakers I couldn't work with. I finally decided to try my hand at creating my own platform that met all my criteria by using  "vibe-coding", which is a dirty word in the self-hosting community. I just wanted to see what was possible with the current state of AI. It turned out to be more successful than I ever could have imagined, which is why I'm making this available for others.

### A bit of background on my specific situation that brought me to create this project:
I've been a rabid user of [Microsoft Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Money) since 1995, when I had my first real job outside of university doing tech support for Microsoft. I started using it to keep track of my finances and to help get myself out of credit card debt. It allowed me to keep track of every aspect of my finances: chequing accounts, credit cards, loans, mortgages, investments, and more. Being software of the 90's, it didn't have much in the way of automation, especially for non-US customers. This forced me to meticulously enter every single transaction manually into Microsoft Money.

This "feature" helped me truly understand the state of my finances. I knew where every single penny went. Nothing was ever a surprise. I could forecast my finances out a year or more with precision. I've kept that going for more than THIRTY YEARS. Yes, even though Microsoft Money hasn't had a new version since 2010, I still use it. Everything from 1995 to today is stored in Microsoft Money. I can tell you my detailed financial picture going back to 1995. It certainly isn't perfect. I can only run it on one machine. There's no mobile app or anything of the sort. When I go on a trip or something, it can take hours after I return to enter and categorize my data. I've been increasingly wanting a true replacement for Microsoft Money. 

My perfect product to replace MS Money needed the following features:
- Must support all types of banking and investment types, including:
  - Chequing
  - Savings
  - Credit Cards
  - Loans
  - Mortgages
  - Line of Credit
  - Brokerage accounts
  - Asset accounts
- Must support importing from QIF (the export format used by MS Money and Quicken)
- Must be self-hostable via containerization
- Must support multiple currencies
- Must support pulling currency exchange rates and stock prices on a regular basis
- Must support PostgreSQL for the backend tables
- Must have a usable mobile app or web interface

Since I couldn't find anything out there to meet that criteria, I decided to create Monize! After weeks of vibe-coding and testing, I finally was able to migrate ALL of 30+ years of Microsoft Money data into Monize with no errors or discrepancies. Microsoft Money has finally been retired!

Monize is running in my [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kenlasko/k8s).

## Features
### Account Management
- Ten account types: Chequing, Savings, Credit Card, Loan, Mortgage, Line of Credit, Investment, Cash, Asset and Other
- A detail page for each account type: balance history, recurring charges (turn one into a scheduled bill with one click) and a 90-day balance forecast for bank accounts; the statement cycle, interest and fees and a payoff calculator for credit cards; value, appreciation and an equity panel against the financing loan for assets
- Financial institutions: group your accounts by bank or brokerage, with the institution's logo
- An investment account is shown as one account (the brokerage and its cash), with a reconciliation status on investment transactions
- Support for multiple currencies per account
- Track balances, credit limits, and interest rates
- Exclude an account from net worth
- Credit card statement dates: configurable due date and settlement date (billing cycle closing date). After you reconcile a card, Monize offers to schedule the payment
- Favourite accounts on dashboard with credit card date indicators
- Account reconciliation: edit, sort and group while you reconcile, an optional lock on reconciled transactions, and highlighted overdue unreconciled transactions
- Export an account to CSV or QIF

### Transaction Management
- Full transaction tracking with categories and payees
- Split transaction support for complex transactions
- Table or Calendar view of the register. Each day shows its transactions and, if you choose, the day's balance or its change. Day notes go on one day or across several
- Sort the register by any column; the running balance is shown in date order
- Search from the header on every page, with amounts and dates typed your own way (`1 234,56`, `02.07.2026`)
- Date fields take partial dates (`9-14`, `4/1/26`, month names), and "Create & New" enters many transactions in a row
- Foreign-currency transactions: enter the amount you were charged, see and edit the rate, and see what foreign-currency fees cost you per account
- Transfers, one-off and scheduled, can carry a category, so they show in category reports without counting as income or expenses
- Attachments for receipts, invoices and statements, stored in the database, on disk or in S3. Scan a paper document with the phone camera (page detection runs in your browser) and preview images and PDFs in the app. An attachment column and filter find the transactions that have no receipt
- Transaction reconciliation and clearing
- Bulk update and bulk delete operations with filter-based selection
- Undo and redo your recent changes from the action history panel
- Payees with auto-categorization rules, aliases with wildcard patterns, and merge capability, plus Auto-Merge for duplicates. Apply a payee's default category to its past transactions
- Payee brand icons and category icons that subcategories inherit
- A page for each payee (statistics, recurrence, seasonality, address, phone and email) and for each category (subcategories, top payees, seasonality). Payee details can be looked up through Google Places or your AI provider, and are shown for confirmation before they are saved
- Multi-currency transactions with automatic exchange rate tracking
- Import from CSV (including brokerage exports), OFX/QFX, and QIF (Quicken and Microsoft Money) with smart column auto-matching
- Microsoft Money full-file import: read a `.mny` file directly -- accounts, transfers, splits, investments, price history, exchange rates and scheduled bills -- and reconcile every balance against the file afterwards ([guide](docs/import-ms-money.md))
- Quicken full-file import: import all accounts, categories, and tags from a single QIF export
- Data reset: wipe financial data and re-import without losing your user account or settings
- Share into the app: with Monize installed as a PWA (Android and desktop Chromium), share a receipt photo, a PDF or a statement export (CSV, OFX, QFX, QIF) to it from another app and land on a review screen that offers to attach it to a new transaction, open the import wizard or send it to the AI Assistant. Nothing is imported or attached until you choose it, and shared files are kept on the device for an hour

### Transaction Rules and Tags
- Transaction rules (Tools > Rules): when a transaction is created or imported and it matches your conditions (account, payee, category, text, amount, day of month, tags and more), add or remove tags, set the category, payee or description, or queue it for an AI review. A visual editor, a test on existing transactions before you save, a run on existing transactions with undo, and a history of every change a rule made. A rule never changes an amount, an account or a date
- An AI review inbox for the transactions a rule queued
- Transaction tags with colours and icons for flexible cross-category labelling
- KEY:VALUE tags (for example `trip:Lisbon`): filter by key, and break Income vs Expenses and Cash Flow down by tag key
- Tags on securities too, with the portfolio charted by tag key

### Investment Features

- Compare securities with each other and against market indexes
- Manual price management: add, edit, and delete individual price entries
- Price backfill from transaction history (uses buy/sell prices when market data unavailable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 24 (for local development -- matches the container images)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (if running without Docker)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kenlasko/monize.git
cd monize
```

2. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and configure. `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` ship empty, and
   the backend will not start until both are filled in:
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - secure database password
   - `JWT_SECRET` - generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
   - `PUBLIC_APP_URL` - your public frontend URL
   - OIDC settings (optional) for SSO authentication

4. Start the application:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

   The `-f` is required: every stack in this repository is an explicit target
   (see the tree above) and there is no default Compose file to fall back on.

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

### Try It with Demo Data

`docker-compose.demo.yml` turns on demo mode on top of the production stack.
With the `.env` from steps 2 and 3:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
```

On its first start the backend seeds a demo account (`demo@monize.com` /
`Demo123!`) with twelve months of data: 15 accounts at five institutions, 36
payees, about 450 transactions with splits and transfers, 10 scheduled
transactions, 8 securities with price history and 4 custom reports. Demo mode
turns off registration, fills in the sign-in form and resets the data every
day at 4:00 AM UTC. The seed is in `backend/src/database/demo-seed-data/`.

The screenshots in this README are made from that data by a Playwright script,
which also adds tags, transaction rules, a budget, loans and other showcase data
through the API. To make them again, see
[`e2e/readme/README.md`](e2e/readme/README.md).

### Development Setup (Without Docker)

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database:
```bash
createdb monize
psql monize < ../database/schema.sql
```

3. Create `backend/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=monize
DATABASE_USER=your_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
JWT_SECRET=            # required: openssl rand -base64 32
ENCRYPTION_KEY=        # required: openssl rand -hex 32
PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

4. Start the backend:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

5. In a new terminal, set up frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp ../.env.example .env.local  # Update INTERNAL_API_URL if needed
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `monize` |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Database user | `monize_user` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password | `secure-password` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key (min 32 random chars; the server will not start without it). A published placeholder or typed pattern still starts but is reported to administrators. Changing it later stops authenticator (2FA) codes from working: see [Changing JWT_SECRET](docs/backend/modules-and-runtime.md#changing-jwt_secret) | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts AI provider keys, emergency-access credentials, each user's backup key and the Web Push and OIDC signing keys (min 32 chars; the server will not start without it). Keep it safe and keep it unchanged -- losing it makes every stored secret unreadable. Formerly `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, which is still accepted | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public frontend URL | `https://money.example.com` |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `INTERNAL_API_URL` | Backend URL for server-side calls | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Additional CORS origin | - |
| `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED` | Enable local auth | `true` |
| `REGISTRATION_ENABLED` | Allow new user registration | `true` |
| `FORCE_2FA` | Require 2FA for all local users | `false` |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | OIDC provider URL | - |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | OIDC client ID | - |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | OIDC client secret | - |
| `OIDC_CALLBACK_URL` | OIDC callback URL | - |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server host | - |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port | `587` |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Force implicit TLS on a port other than 465. Port 465 already selects it, and this cannot switch it off | `false` |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username | - |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password | - |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Email sender address | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` | System-level default AI provider (the centrally managed AI) | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model for the provider | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_API_KEY` | System-wide AI API key | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | Base URL for Ollama or compatible endpoints | - |
| `AI_PRIVATE_BASE_URL_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated `host` or `host:port` private addresses a non-admin user's Ollama or OpenAI-compatible provider may use. Without an entry, only an admin can point a provider at a private or local address | - |
| `AI_QUERY_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Analysis steps per AI Assistant question, centrally managed provider only | `5` |
| `AI_QUERY_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` | Data lookups per question, centrally managed provider only | `15` |
| `AI_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | Wall-clock minutes per question, centrally managed provider only | `20` |
| `AI_QUERY_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` | Cumulative input tokens per question, centrally managed provider only | `200000` |
| `AI_QUERY_MAX_TOOL_RESULT_CHARS` | Characters kept from one tool result, centrally managed provider only | `50000` |
| `JWT_EXPIRATION` | JWT token expiration time | `15m` |
| `REMEMBER_ME_DAYS` | Duration for "Remember Me" sessions (days) | `30` |
| `DISABLE_HTTPS_HEADERS` | Disable HSTS and COOP headers for plain HTTP | `false` |
| `DEMO_MODE` | Enable demo mode with sample data | `false` |
| `BACKUP_CONTAINER_DIR` | Container folder automatic backups are written to (each user gets a `<ab>/<cd>/<user-id>/` folder underneath it) | `/data/backups` |
| `BACKUP_HOST_DIR` | Host folder mapped to `BACKUP_CONTAINER_DIR` by docker-compose | `./monize/backups` |
| `ATTACHMENT_CONTAINER_DIR` | Container folder local attachments are written to (was `ATTACHMENT_LOCAL_DIR`) | `/data/attachments` |
| `ATTACHMENT_HOST_DIR` | Host folder mapped to `ATTACHMENT_CONTAINER_DIR` by docker-compose | `./monize/attachments` |

The `AI_DEFAULT_*` and `AI_QUERY_*` variables configure the **centrally managed
AI** -- the provider used for any user who has not configured one of their own.
A user who adds their own provider in Settings -> AI owns its settings
completely, per-provider query limits included, and the environment does not
reach them.


## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Production)

1. Create `.env` from the example and set production values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set NODE_ENV=production, strong passwords, your domain, etc.
```

2. Build and start:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Kubernetes

The application is Kubernetes-ready with:
- Health endpoints: `/api/v1/health/live` and `/api/v1/health/ready`
- Standalone Next.js build for minimal image size
- Environment-based configuration

Example environment for K8s:
```yaml
# Frontend pod
- name: INTERNAL_API_URL
  value: "http://backend-svc:3000"
- name: PUBLIC_APP_URL
  value: "https://money.example.com"

# Backend pod
- name: PUBLIC_APP_URL
  value: "https://money.example.com"
```
