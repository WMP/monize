 * given installment looks like -- the copy each held drifted twice before this
 * existed (audit P5-008, recheck DR3-01, review #1131).
 * `loan-waterfall.guard.spec.ts` fails on a new hand-rolled copy.
 *
 * Policy, decided once:
 *
 * - A payment that does not cover the accrued interest is applied
 *   interest-first across the WHOLE installment, extra principal included. A
 *   lender applies a payment to accrued interest before principal, so a
 *   designated extra-principal transfer has no principal to reduce until the
 *   interest is met. Interest itself is bounded by the whole installment so a
 *   child can never exceed its parent.
 * - An installment below the accrued interest (the interest exceeds the WHOLE
 *   installment, extra included) leaves a shortfall, reported as
 *   `unpaidInterest`. A caller that settles an outside payment keeps the cap
 *   (interest = the installment, principal 0): its shortfall policy is its
 *   own. A scheduled bill passes `capitalizeUnpaidInterest`: the whole interest
 *   is booked, the principal is the NEGATIVE of the shortfall (a transfer line
 *   FROM the loan) and the extra is 0, so the lines still sum to the
 *   installment and the loan's debt grows by the interest nobody paid, in the
 *   same posting. Nothing is a separate row a delete or an undo could orphan.
 *   Where the installment covers the interest and the base payment does not,
 *   the extra sheds first and `unpaidInterest` is 0.
 * - Never schedule more principal than the loan still owes. Regular principal
 *   is what the amortization says is owed, so it is filled first; the
 *   discretionary extra absorbs the shortfall. Interest is not clamped by the
 *   balance -- it accrued on the debt and is owed independently of how much
 *   principal is left to retire.
 * - What is left of the installment after interest is the most that can go to
 *   principal in total, so the extra is bounded by that as well as by the
 *   debt.
 * - The parts only ever shrink from the configured figures, and the total is
 *   the sum of the parts by construction, so the split validator's exact-4dp
 *   equality between parent and children cannot be reached with a mismatch.

 *
 * The waterfall prices at storage precision (docs/specs/mortgage-types.md,
 * decision 7), so a LINEAR installment is 864.5833 principal + 306.0625
 * interest = 1,170.6458; the account it is debited from moves 1,170.65. The
 * total and the interest are each rounded to the unit and principal takes
 * what the roundings leave (864.59), because interest is the period's charge
 * and principal is what retires the loan. Where principal is zero (an
 * interest-only installment carrying an extra), the extra takes it instead,
 * so no line turns negative. The parts still sum to the total exactly.
 *
 * A principal that is negative on purpose (a capitalized shortfall,
 * `capitalizeUnpaidInterest`) stays on the principal line: the rounding
 * difference is absorbed there and `unpaidInterest` is its magnitude as
 * booked.
 *
 * Booking never retires more than `debt`. A ledger posted at 4dp before
 * #1581 can owe 833.3449 on its final installment, and rounding would book
 * 833.35 and push the loan into credit; there the principal is cut down to
 * the unit at or below the debt (833.34), leaving a residue of less than one
 * unit that the next occurrence reads as paid off (a debt below 0.01). A ledger
 * booked in the unit owes a whole number of units, so its final installment
 * retires it exactly.
