/**
 * `accounts.payment_frequency` is a bare `VARCHAR(20)` that two paths write in
 * two spellings: the mortgage form stores the mortgage enum's `SEMI_MONTHLY`,
 * the loan-payment setup dialog stores the recurrence's `SEMIMONTHLY`. A caller
 * reading it back holds a string, and casting that string into
 * `MortgagePaymentFrequency` compiles while handing `getMortgagePeriodsPerYear`
 * a value it has no case for -- its `default: 12` then turned SEMIMONTHLY into a
 * monthly rate.
 *
 * Six call sites did it. Every one of them books money: the per-posting P/I
 * split, the rate-change recalculation and its scheduled-transaction sync, the
 * inference warning, and the account service's own split -- so a semi-monthly
 * mortgage was charged twice the correct interest on every payment for the life
 * of the loan, a quarterly one three times.
 *
 * Fixing five of six is what happened the first time (the setup service was
 * converted and the rest were not), which is why this is a scan rather than a
 * paragraph: `periodsPerYearForStoredFrequency` answers the count for a string
 * in either domain, `toMortgagePaymentFrequency` converts when a mortgage-domain
 * value is genuinely needed, and the cast has nowhere left to be correct.
