 * contribution reversed by `removeLockedTransactionLeg` (`deletionBalanceEffect`
 * of the locked row), so a leg already gone, or relinked elsewhere, is skipped
 * and moves nothing. The split lines are deleted and the row's category and
 * structural flags come back from the snapshot.

 * A settled row (`structure.claimId`) also has its occurrence claim released
 * and, when the claim advanced the schedule's cursor, the advance rewound
 * (`docs/specs/loan-installment-settlement.md` section 12.6): under the
 * schedule row lock, the undo first refuses when the schedule holds a later
 * claim the run did not write (`RULE_RUN_UNDO_LATER_SETTLEMENT`, so a
 * settlement priced on this run's principal is never left standing on a debt
 * that no longer exists), then walks the settled rows in reverse run order,
 * so a schedule the run advanced twice is put back one advance at a time.
