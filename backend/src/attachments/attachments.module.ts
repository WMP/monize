 * selected by ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER: "database" (default) keeps bytes in
 * Postgres BYTEA; "local" writes them to a filesystem directory; "s3" stores
 * them in S3-compatible object storage. Entities are auto-registered via the
 * datasource glob, so no forFeature is needed -- the service reads repositories
 * from the withScopedDb EntityManager.
