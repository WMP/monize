 * zero-dependency alternative to Postgres BYTEA for deployments that would
 * rather keep large blobs off the database (e.g. a mounted volume) without
 * running object storage.
 *
 * Files are fanned out into two levels of subdirectory keyed by the first four
 * hex characters of the id (`<ab>/<cd>/<id>`) rather than dumped flat into a
 * single directory -- the shared layout in `common/shard-path.util.ts`, which
 * automatic backups use for their per-user folders too.
 *
 * Bytes live outside the database, but they DO travel in an application backup:
 * the export reads each object and carries it base64-encoded in
 * `attachment_blobs` (see `appendExternalAttachmentBytes`), and a restore stages
 * it back through this provider. That is what makes a backup restorable onto a
 * fresh instance, and it means this directory does not have to be backed up
 * separately. An artifact exported before that change carries only metadata, and
 * restoring one needs more than this store: the bytes are read from the CURRENT
 * instance and only after it confirms the user already owns a matching
 * `transaction_attachments` row (same id, provider, size, SHA-256), so on a fresh
 * instance every external attachment is skipped however faithfully the store was
 * restored.
