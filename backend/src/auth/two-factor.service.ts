   * administrator. The forced-enrolment redirect then sends them straight back
   * into setup.
   *
   * It takes both proofs -- the account password and a second factor -- and
   * never one alone: a 6-digit authenticator code or one backup code, as sign-in
   * accepts. There is deliberately no password-only path, not even when the
   * TOTP secret is undecryptable: a stolen session plus a phished or reused
   * password must not be enough to strip the second factor. With an
   * undecryptable secret a 6-digit code is simply an invalid code (counted), and
   * a backup code -- bcrypt-hashed, independent of `JWT_SECRET` -- still works.
   * A user with neither needs the administrator reset.
   *
   * Every failure, password or code, draws on the same per-user TOTP budget as

   * cannot interleave; the attempt is reserved before that transaction, on the
   * counter's own connection, because a counter joined to it would roll back
   * with the refusal.
   *
   * Only the refresh-token families other than `currentRefreshToken`'s are
   * revoked, after the commit (`TokenService.revokeAllUserRefreshTokens`
   * converges over several transactions of its own): a session the exposed
   * factor may have admitted ends, while the one asking stays signed in to
   * enroll. Personal access tokens and OAuth grants are left alone; they never
   * passed a second factor, so replacing it does not bear on them, and the
