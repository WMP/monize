/**
 * How an AI provider's API key travels in a backup.
 *
 * `ai_provider_configs.api_key_enc` is ciphertext under `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
 * which is server configuration: it is not in the backup and cannot be, because
 * shipping the master key beside the ciphertext would make encrypting the column
 * pointless. Exporting the ciphertext verbatim therefore produced a row that
 * restores onto a *different* instance -- or onto the same one after that
 * variable was rotated or regenerated -- populated and unreadable. Nothing said
 * so: the column is non-null, so every "is a key configured?" check answered yes
 * and the provider row drew a masked key, and the only symptom was that AI calls
 * failed.
 *
 * So the key is decrypted on the way out and re-encrypted on the way in, under
 * whichever key the receiving instance holds. The backup becomes self-contained
 * for this column, which is the property the rest of the file already has.
 *
 * **The artifact then holds the key in plaintext.** That is the cost, and it is
 * not hidden: a backup is normally encrypted with the user's own password, but an
 * unencrypted export (an OIDC account that has set no backup password) and an
 * unencrypted automatic backup on disk both put third-party provider credentials
 * in a readable file. `BackupExportService` logs when it writes one. The support
 * (de-identified) backup drops `ai_provider_configs` entirely and is unaffected
 * -- see `support-backup-rules.ts`, which must keep dropping it.
 *
 * Both directions live here rather than at the two call sites, because the field
 * name and the fallback rules are one contract: an export that writes a field the
 * restore does not read loses the key silently, in exactly the way this file
 * exists to stop.
 */

/**
 * Where the decrypted key rides. A separate field, never `api_key_enc` itself:
 * that column's name is a claim about its contents, and a restore has to be able
 * to tell "plaintext to re-encrypt" from "ciphertext from this instance" without
 * guessing at the shape of the string.
