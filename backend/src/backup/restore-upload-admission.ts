/**
 * Aggregate admission for restore uploads, in front of the body parser.
 *
 * `resolveRestoreUploadLimitBytes` bounds **one** request. It cannot bound two.
 * `express.raw` buffers the whole body onto the heap before the controller, the
 * JWT guard and the global `ThrottlerGuard` -- those are Nest guards, and they
 * run after parsing -- so two unauthenticated clients each streaming just under
 * the per-request ceiling allocate twice the ceiling on a container sized for
 * one, and the only replica is OOM-killed. Nothing further down the path can
 * refuse an allocation that has already happened.
 *
 * So the process keeps a running total of the bytes it has promised, and a
 * request is admitted only if its own claim still fits.
 *
 * ## The claim is the peak, not the wire
 *
 * The first version reserved the declared `Content-Length` and nothing else, which
 * counted the smallest of the buffers a restore holds. An encrypted 60 MiB upload
 * is the envelope, plus `decipher.update`'s output, plus `Buffer.concat`'s new
 * buffer, plus the decompressed payload, plus the UTF-8 string, plus the parsed
 * object graph -- several of them live at the same moment. Three such uploads
 * declared 180 MiB, fitted a 200 MiB budget, and could pass 540 MiB in flight.
 *
 * So a request claims `PEAK_MULTIPLE` times its wire bytes. That number is a
 * deliberate underestimate of the true worst case and an enormous improvement on
 * 1: it makes the budget refuse the several-smaller-uploads case, which is the one
 * the wire-byte version admitted. The honest fix is streaming the input through
 * decryption and gzip into a bounded temporary file or an incremental parser,
 * which is a change to the restore pipeline rather than to this gate.
 *
 * ## A reservation is held until the work is done, not until the socket shuts
 *
 * `ServerResponse` emits `close` when the connection ends, which is not the same
 * as the handler finishing. Releasing on `close` let a client upload a full body,
 * let the controller enter `restoreData`, then hang up -- freeing the whole
 * reservation while the decryption, the staging and the SQL were still running and
 * still holding their buffers. A second large upload was then admitted beside the
 * first, which is exactly the situation this gate exists to prevent, reachable by
 * disconnect timing.
 *
 * So the reservation has a lifecycle:
 *
 * - **receiving** -- the body is still arriving. A `close` here means the client
 *   went away before anything downstream took ownership, so releasing is right.
 * - **processing** -- the body has been read, so the handler owns it. Only the
 *   handler saying it is finished (`releaseRestoreReservation`, from a `finally`)
 *   or the response completing (`finish`) releases it. A `close` is ignored.
 *
 * A request that never reaches the route -- rejected by a guard, a 404 -- still
 * gets a response, so `finish` covers it.
 *
 * ## What is still not fixed
 *
 * An unauthenticated client can occupy the budget, because the gate necessarily
 * runs before authentication. `receiveTimeoutMs` bounds how long: a body that has
 * not arrived by then is refused with 408 and its reservation released, so a
 * slow-loris holds the recovery path for a bounded interval rather than
 * indefinitely. The real answers -- a smaller body limit at the ingress, a
 * two-step restore session with a short-lived upload token, streaming to disk --
 * are in `docs/backup-restore-contract.md`.
