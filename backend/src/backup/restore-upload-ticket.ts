/**
 * A short-lived, authenticated ticket that must accompany a restore upload
 * (DR-F3RB-003, issue #1073).
 *
 * The upload admission gate has to run in front of `express.raw`, because that is
 * what allocates the body -- and in front of the body parser means in front of
 * Nest's guards, so the gate necessarily budgets memory for requests it cannot
 * authenticate. Until now the only bound on that was time: an unauthenticated
 * client could hold part of the restore budget until the receive deadline expired,
 * degrading a legitimate restore to a retry during exactly the incident a restore
 * is for.
 *
 * Authentication cannot move later, so authorization moves earlier. A caller first
 * asks an ordinary authenticated JSON route (`POST /backup/restore/ticket`, behind
 * the JWT guard, CSRF and the throttler) for a ticket, and the admission middleware
 * verifies it **before reserving anything**. A request with no ticket is refused
 * having claimed no memory at all.
 *
 * **The refusal is 403, not 401**, and the difference is not pedantry: the caller's
 * session is present and valid -- it is this *request* that carries no upload
 * authorization. A 401 would also be read by the client's interceptor as an expired
 * session, which retries the original request after refreshing the token: a silent
 * re-upload of the whole artifact, and a logout mid-restore if the refresh fails.
 * A status is part of the contract with the client, not just a number.
 *
 * ## Signed, not stored
 *
 * The ticket is an HMAC over `{userId, expiry}` rather than a database row, and
 * that is a deliberate trade:
 *
 * - **It works on every replica.** A row would work too, but an in-memory set --
 *   the version that needs no migration -- would not: the ticket is minted on the
 *   pod that served the JSON request and the upload can land on another, so the
 *   restore path would fail on exactly the multi-replica deployments it matters on.
 * - **It costs nothing on the pre-parse path.** Verification is one HMAC, so the
 *   middleware stays synchronous and allocation-free. A database round trip in
 *   front of the body parser would be a new lever for the load it exists to refuse.
 * - **It is not single-use.** A stored ticket could be consumed by a conditional
 *   `UPDATE`; this one can be replayed until it expires. What that buys an attacker
 *   is bounded: the ticket authorizes *occupying upload budget*, not restoring
 *   anything -- the restore itself still needs the caller's JWT, the CSRF pair, and
 *   for an OIDC account a single-use re-authentication artifact. And whoever holds
 *   a ticket held a session cookie a moment ago, which could mint another. The TTL
 *   is what bounds it.
 *
 * The signing key is derived from `JWT_SECRET` with a domain separator, so a ticket
 * can never be confused with (or forged from) an access token, and rotating
 * `JWT_SECRET` invalidates outstanding tickets -- which is the correct behaviour for
 * a five-minute credential.
