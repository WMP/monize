/**
 * The one PostgreSQL connection a replica holds outside the pool, for
 * `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`.
 *
 * `CLUSTER_MODE=multi` needs a way to tell another replica "go and re-read that
 * row" -- the browser's SSE stream lives on one pod and the agent's answer
 * arrives on another. PostgreSQL has that channel built in, so there is no
 * second store to run; what it costs is a connection that cannot be pooled in
 * transaction mode, because `LISTEN` is session state and a pooler hands the
 * next statement to a different server session. `db-init` and `db-migrate`
 * already require a direct endpoint for the lifecycle advisory lock
 * (`common/db/advisory-locks.ts`), so `multi` adds a second reason for a
 * requirement the deployment already has rather than a new one.
 *
 * **This connection touches no table.** `LISTEN` and `pg_notify()` read and
 * write nothing, so there is no tenant to establish and no policy to apply:
 * routing it through `withScopedDb` would emit identity GUCs for a statement
 * that cannot reach a row, and would put a transaction around a session-scoped
 * command that must outlive it. It is the second sanctioned direct-connection
 * path in `docs/row-level-security-contract.md`, section 4, which says what the
 * boundary is and what it does not authorize.
 *
 * The credentials are the runtime role's, resolved exactly as
 * `app.module.ts` resolves the pool's: `LISTEN` and `pg_notify()` need no
 * privilege the runtime role lacks, and a long-lived connection in the serving
 * process is the last place the owner's credentials belong.
 *
 * A wake-up may be lost -- a notification sent while this connection is
 * reconnecting reaches nobody, and PostgreSQL acknowledges no delivery -- so
 * every waiter also polls on a slow timer and a notification only shortens the
 * wait. `common/events/event-bus.interface.ts` states that rule for the bus
 * built on top of this (task R6).
