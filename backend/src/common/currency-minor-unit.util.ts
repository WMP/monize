 * cents, so the posted transaction carries the parent rounded to the unit

 * roundings leave (here +0.01) on the line at `absorbIndex` (864.59), so the
 * lines sum to the parent exactly and the split validator's 4dp equality
 * holds.
 *
 * Only a rounding difference is moved: when the lines did not already sum to
 * the parent at 4dp (an occurrence override that changed the amount and not
 * the lines), the gap is not this function's to place, so the lines are only
 * rounded and the split editor shows the imbalance for the user to settle.
