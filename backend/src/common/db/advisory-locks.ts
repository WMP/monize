/**
 * Session advisory locks the startup paths take.
 *
 * `db-init` and `db-migrate` both run in **every** backend process. Neither took
 * a lock, and both are check-then-act: the initializer asks whether `users`
 * exists and then applies `schema.sql`; the migrator reads the applied-filename
 * set and then applies each pending file. Start two pods against a fresh
 * database, or against one pending migration, and both decide the same work is
 * outstanding. One wins; the other hits duplicate DDL or the tracker's primary
 * key, rolls back, and exits non-zero under `set -e`. It usually succeeds after
 * a restart, once it can see the winner's state -- so the symptom is a
 * crash-looping pod during every rollout that carries a migration, and a
 * rollout that looks like it is failing when it is only racing.
 *
 * The two scripts are separate processes on separate connections, so no one
 * session holds the lock from init through migrate. Instead each takes the
 * **same** key for the duration of its own run, which serialises every pairing
 * that matters -- two initializers, two migrators, and an initializer applying
 * `schema.sql` while a migrator replays migrations on top of it -- because each
 * script re-reads the database's state after acquiring rather than trusting a
 * decision made before the wait. Session-scoped rather than transaction-scoped
 * because the migrator's work spans many transactions -- one per migration file
 * -- and Postgres releases the lock when the connection closes, which happens
 * in the `finally` of each script and also if the process is killed. There is
 * no unlock to forget and no stuck lock to clean up.
 *
 * The backend's pooled runtime connections never take session advisory locks --
 * the RLS design forbids cross-transaction session state there
 * (docs/future-plans/row-level-security.md). These scripts are the deliberate
 * exception: each holds one dedicated `pg.Client` connection for its whole run
 * and then closes it. That shape requires the startup scripts to reach
 * Postgres directly; routed through a transaction-mode pooler (pgBouncer), the
 * lock and the DDL could land on different server sessions.

 * container, a connection the server still believes is alive) would otherwise
 * hang every replica's startup forever, with nothing in the log but the
 * waiting line. Timing out turns that into a non-zero exit naming the cause,

 * re-reading the state is the only outcome that leaves every replica running.
