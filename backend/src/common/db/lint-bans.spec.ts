 * The documented set of prohibited database primitives must be the configured

 * `CONTRIBUTING.md` told contributors to use `QueryRunner` transactions for every
 * multi-table write, long after the root instructions and ESLint had prohibited
 * them, and the auxiliary agent guidance demonstrated `dataSource.transaction`.
 * Nothing failed, because a document cannot be type-checked -- so a contributor
 * or an agent following official guidance produced code CI rejects, or worse,
 * code that evades the narrow syntax rule and merges.
 *
 * Fixing the wording is not the fix. This ties the two together: a ban added to
 * the config that no instruction file mentions fails here, and so does an
 * instruction naming a ban the config does not have. It reads the config as text
 * on purpose -- importing it would execute a flat-config module for its side
 * effects and still not enumerate the selectors.
