/**
 * The tables deliberately left without a row-level-security policy.
 *
 * This list is the reason it exists: it was written out four times -- in
 * `database/migrations/114_rls_policies_special.sql`, in the exemption block at
 * the foot of `database/schema.sql`, and once in each of the two RLS
 * integration specs -- and had already drifted. The migration documented four
 * tables while the schema and both specs carried six (`market_index_prices` and
 * `market_index_sync` arrived later and reached only three of the four sites),
 * one spec asserted the count in its own name (`leaves the four exempt tables
 * untouched`) for a list of six, and the migration claimed "the catalog-driven
 * test in T2 asserts this exact list" when by then it asserted a different one.
 *
 * Both specs need a live PostgreSQL, so none of that ran in `npm run test:unit`
 * and nothing failed. `rls-exempt-tables.spec.ts` checks this constant against
 * the schema's block in both directions with no database at all.
 *
 * The rationale for each entry is `docs/row-level-security-contract.md`. Keep
 * the reasons here to one line: the contract carries the long form, and a
 * paragraph repeated in two places is how the previous four copies diverged.
