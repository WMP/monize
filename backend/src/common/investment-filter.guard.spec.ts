/**
 * The other half of the rule, and the half a substring match cannot carry:

 *
 * A query that JOINS `transaction_splits` classifies each line, so the
 * split-aware conjunction is enough. A query that reads only the parent cannot:
 * `t.amount` on a split parent is the sum of ALL its children, and an embedded
 * investment line's `transaction_id` is null, so the transaction-level linkage
 * cannot see it -- that query has to derive its amount through
 * `reportableTransactionAmountSql` (branch audit F-RPT-001). Accepting the
 * substring `INVESTMENT_EXCLUSION` would pass a parent-only query that chose the
 * `_NO_SPLITS` variant, which is exactly the defect.
 *
 * Two exemptions, both derived from the query rather than kept as a list of file
 * names a new query could quietly join: one restricted to transfers (an
 * investment cash leg is never a transfer), and one that declares itself a
 * PARENT-IDENTITY REPORT, whose subject is the stored row rather than its cash
 * meaning.
 *
 * "Restricted to transfers" is positive proof, not the presence of the token:
 * the monthly category breakdown admits `is_transfer = false` rows AND, in an OR
 * branch, categorized transfer outflows, so matching `is_transfer = true`
 * anywhere exempted a split-joining ledger query from the whole scan -- deleting
 * its exclusion would have left the guard green (re-audit F-GUARD-001). A query
 * that mentions both forms is not restricted to either.
