/**
 * The parallel Jest config must not be able to discover a database-backed spec.
 *
 * Every suite under `test/integration/` builds its schema through
 * `INTEGRATION_TYPEORM_OPTIONS` (`test/helpers/integration-setup.ts`) with
 * `synchronize: true` and `dropSchema: true` against the one shared
 * `monize_test` database. Two workers doing that concurrently drop the tables
 * out from under each other, which surfaces as
 * `duplicate key value violates unique constraint pg_type_typname_nsp_index`
 * or a "connection terminated" from a spec unrelated to the one that raced --
 * roughly ten suites failing nondeterministically per run.
 *
 * The rule was written down (`integration-setup.ts` says to keep
 * `maxWorkers: 1` in `test/jest-e2e.json`, and `docs/backend/testing.md` documents
 * the split) and was violated anyway: the root config in `package.json` used
 * `rootDir: "."` with `testRegex: ".*\\.spec\\.ts$"`, so a bare `jest` -- what
 * `npm test`, `test:watch` and `test:debug` all ran -- swept `src/` and
 * `test/integration/` into the same parallel run. CI was never affected; it
 * calls `test:unit` and `test:integration` separately. Only the default local
 * entry point was broken, which is exactly the kind of thing prose does not
 * fix. This is the version the machine checks.
 *
 * Six claims, because excluding the integration specs from the parallel config
 * is only correct if they still run somewhere, still run serially, and no other
 * entry point walks back in:
 *
 *  0. every spec that builds a live schema lives under `test/`, which is what
 *     makes a directory-shaped split meaningful in the first place;
 *  1. no tracked spec under `test/` is discoverable by the root config, and
 *     every tracked spec under `src/` still is (an exclusion that also drops
 *     unit coverage would otherwise pass claim 1 trivially);
 *  2. every tracked spec under `test/integration/` is discoverable by
 *     `test/jest-e2e.json`, which pins `maxWorkers: 1`;
 *  3. `npm test` runs the two suites in order and refuses arguments, proved by
 *     running the chain script rather than by reading it;
 *  4. no script reaching the database-backed suites runs them unserialized or
 *     under a watcher, and none redefines discovery on the command line, which
 *     would step around every config-shaped check here;
 *  5. every Jest entry point survives both shells npm uses, and nothing in the
 *     tree that can start a runner carries a zero-discovery success flag
 *     (REL-001), so a discovery failure cannot report as green.
 *
 * Claims 4 and 5 derive their subjects -- the scripts, the configs they select
 * and the files that can launch a runner -- from the manifests and the tracked
 * tree rather than naming them, because a guard whose inventory has to be
 * updated by hand fails exactly when someone adds an entry point without
 * thinking of it.
 *
 * The inventory comes from `git ls-files`, so the guard sees the tree CI sees.
 * A brand-new spec is invisible to it until staged -- `git add -N` is enough.
