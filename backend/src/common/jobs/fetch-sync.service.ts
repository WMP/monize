 *
 * Spelled out so a typo is a compile error rather than a second lease nobody
 * contends for -- which would look exactly like the job working.
 *
 * The first three are the outbound market-data fetches this table was added for.
 * The fourth is the attachment relocation pass, which is not a fetch but has the
 * same shape for the same reason: its writes converge whoever runs them (per-row,
 * under a lock, idempotent by key), so what a second replica duplicates is the
 * cost -- reads and writes of bytes that end up identical -- and not the result.

/**
 * One replica per tick does the work.
 *
 * Every replica fires the FX, security-price and market-index crons. Their
 * writes are idempotent upserts, so the *data* converges however many run --
 * what does not converge is the cost: N replicas is N times the provider calls,
 * N times the rate-limit budget, and N chances to trip the breaker on a
 * provider that is merely slow. The attachment relocation pass joins them on the
 * same terms, with object-store traffic in place of provider calls.
 *
 * So this is a **cost control, not a correctness mechanism**, and that decides
 * its shape at every point:
 *
 * - A lease, never a permanent claim. A holder that crashes must not block the
 *   next tick, so the lease is shorter than the cron's interval and a lost one
 *   is reclaimed by the expiry alone, with nobody to notice.
 * - A lost claim is a debug line and a return, never an error. Losing is the
 *   normal outcome for every replica but one.
 * - `release` and `markSuccess` address the row **by token**, the way
 *   `JobClaimService` does: a worker delayed past its own expiry must not hand
 *   back a lease another replica has since retaken.
 *
 * Not `JobClaimService`: `job_claims.user_id` is a `NOT NULL` foreign key to
 * `users`, and these fetches belong to no user -- one USD/EUR rate serves
 * everybody. Not `market_index_sync` either, which keeps its own per-index
 * attempt cooldown: that decides how often ONE index is worth re-asking for,
 * this decides which replica asks at all.
 *
 * Every call needs an ambient identity, like any other database access -- the
 * claim and the release included, so the caller's `withSystemContext` goes around
 * the whole `withLease` call and not around only the body it runs.
