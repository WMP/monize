 * truth, and the expression `docs/specs/account-balances-as-of.md` section 3
 * defines the balances-as-of report by.
 *
 * It was written out four times (the current-balance recalculation, the
 * projected balance, the balances-as-of report, the balance forecast), and the
 * copies had already drifted -- two of them scope the join by `user_id` and two
 * do not. Nothing checked them against each other, so the next change to what
 * counts toward a balance would have landed on some copies and not others.
 *
 * That matters most for the scheduled loan bill (INV-LOAN-006): its whole claim
 * is that the debt it prices and the balance the report shows are *the same
 * measurement*, which is only true while the predicates agree. So the clauses
 * live here as data, and `ledger-balance-sql.spec.ts` scans `src/` for a
 * hand-written copy.
