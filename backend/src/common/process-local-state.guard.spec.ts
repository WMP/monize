/**
 * Every backend replica is interchangeable, so a `Map` or a `Set` held on a
 * class is state only *this* process can see. Where that state decides
 * something -- an attempt budget, a replay window, a claim, a session -- N
 * replicas mean N answers, and the deployment quietly gets N times the limit it
 * wrote down. That is the whole of the horizontal-scaling work
 * (`docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling.md`): the counters, the single-use
 * artifacts, the relay queue and the signing keys became rows.
 *
 * `db/derived-state-writers.guard.spec.ts` already scans the files containing an
 * `@Cron(` for this shape, with a narrower and stronger claim (a cron guard held
 * in memory is not a guard). This is the same scan widened to the whole tree,
 * where the claim is weaker and the answer is therefore an allowlist rather than
 * a refusal: some per-replica state is correct, and the point of the guard is
 * that each instance is a *written* decision instead of an unexamined default.
 *
 * What it can and cannot see:
 *
 *  - It matches `Map`, `Set` and `EmptyWindowMemory` fields at class scope. A
 *    `new Map()` inside a method is a local and never matches -- the regex
 *    anchors on the `private`/`protected` modifier.
 *  - It skips a field whose declared type is `ReadonlySet`/`ReadonlyMap`: the
 *    type already forbids the mutation this guard is about, and a constant
 *    lookup table is not state. That is the machine holding the rule, which is
 *    the shape this repo prefers to an allowlist entry.
 *  - It does not match arrays, scalars or `WeakMap`/`WeakSet`, so it is not the
 *    whole of the "is this per-replica state correct?" question. The design
 *    doc's "Per-replica state that stays" table is; `yahoo-finance.service.ts`'s
 *    crumb and `email.service.ts`'s failure scalars are in that table and out
 *    of this regex's reach.
 *  - It reads code, not comments: a `private readonly x = new Map()` written out
 *    in a doc comment as an example is blanked before the scan.
 *
 * The allowlist is keyed by `path#field` rather than by file, so a new map in a
 * file that already has one is still reported, and by field rather than by line
 * so moving a declaration does not churn it. It may shrink; it grows only with a
 * reason in the same PR that adds the field.
