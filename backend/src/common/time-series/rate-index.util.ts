/**
 * The bulk-loaded form of the exchange-rate history: every stored observation a
 * reported window can need, indexed by pair, so a chart of 400 points resolves
 * its rates from one query instead of 400.
 *
 * The *policy* -- which observation applies to a date, how old it may be, which
 * direction wins -- is not here. It is `fx-rate-resolver.ts`, the one door every
 * surface asks. This module's only job is to load enough rows that the door can
 * give the same answer for a date whatever window the caller happened to
 * request, and to hand them over in the shape the door reads.
 *
 * What "enough rows" means: for any date `d` inside the window, the answer is
 * the newest observation in `[d - FX_MAX_RATE_AGE_DAYS, d]`. Those dated on or
 * after the window's start are loaded wholesale; of those before it, only the
 * single newest one can ever be chosen, and anything older than the age bound
 * measured from the start is older than the bound measured from any `d` in the
 * window too. So the in-window rows plus one preceding row per pair are exactly
 * sufficient -- which is why a fixed day margin (this file used to load 90 days
 * back and 31 days *ahead*) was the wrong shape: it made a point's rate depend
 * on how wide the chart was, and the forward margin let a date be priced by an
 * observation from its future (issue #1390).
