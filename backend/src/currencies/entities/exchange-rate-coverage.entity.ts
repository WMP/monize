/**
 * What a rate provider is known to hold for one currency pair, and where the
 * next history fill should resume.
 *
 * `ExchangeRateHistoryService` derived both facts from scratch on every press
 * and could keep neither. A pair whose provider history begins long after the
 * reader's own data does -- Yahoo carries nothing for `USDCAD=X` before
 * December 2003, against a ledger opening in 1996 -- paid one provider call per
 * dead year to learn that again after every restart, and a stretch the provider
 * had already answered as well as it can was re-asked for on the press after
 * next.
 *
 * **One row per pair, never per direction.** A rate window answers a pair, so
 * two rows would be the same divergence `exchange_rates` was collapsed to avoid
 * (INV-FX-003). The canonical orientation is `from < to`, the same rule
 * `canonicalRateRow` applies, and the CHECK constraint is what holds it rather
 * than a convention in the writer.
 *
 * **Scoped to a provider set.** What one chain of providers carries is not
 * what another does, so the row names the chain that wrote it (`providers`)
 * and is ignored, then replaced, under any other `FX_PROVIDERS` configuration.
 *
 * Global reference data with no owner column, like `exchange_rates` itself:
 * what a provider carries is the same fact for every account on the deployment.
 * RLS-exempt for that reason (`docs/row-level-security-contract.md`).
