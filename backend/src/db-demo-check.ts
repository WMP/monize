/**
 * Demo-mode startup probe: exits 0 when the demo user already exists (the
 * entrypoint then skips seeding) and 1 when it does not, or when the check
 * itself could not run -- seeding is idempotent, so a failed probe re-seeds
 * rather than leaving a demo deployment empty.
 *
 * This used to be a `node -e` blob inside docker-entrypoint.sh with `echo`
 * around it, which put four unformatted lines at the top of every demo
 * startup. As a compiled script it logs through the Nest `Logger` like the
 * rest of the boot sequence.
 *
 * The probe takes the database-lifecycle lock before it reads, for the same
 * reason `db-init` does: two demo containers started together both find no demo
 * user, both exit 1, and both seed. Waiting means the follower's read happens
 * after the winner's seed instead of alongside it.
 *
 * The lock does not span the exit, though -- the shell runs the seeder as a
 * separate process, and a session lock dies with its connection. That is why
 * `seed.ts` re-reads this same predicate after taking the lock itself: the
 * probe narrows the window, the seeder's re-check closes it.
