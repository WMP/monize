 * (never by the email's schema.org markup); `abs(T)` equals the parsed total
 * exactly (whatever tolerance the profile matched with); the match is by order
 * number, by the profile's reference, or by amount plus payee; the card was
 * built. A match by amount and date alone (`amount_date`) never auto-applies.
 * Stricter than the spec in one way: the stored proposal must be the
 * category lines themselves (itemized or one category), not a description-only
 * proposal or the fallback of a refused one, because the design promises that
 * what is applied "balances to the cent". A receipt with a joined or scaled
 * part (linked receipts 7) never auto-applies, nor does a forward: who sent it
 * is what its text says, and a person decides whether to believe it.
