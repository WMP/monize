/**
 * The work every import pipeline does once its rows are written: recompute
 * balances, backfill prices and FX rates, and kick a net-worth recalculation.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from `ImportService.postImportProcessing` so the QIF/OFX/CSV
 * path and the `.mny` path share one implementation. Two copies of this would
 * drift, and the balance query in particular is load-bearing: the `.mny`
 * verification report compares the file's own computed balances against what this
 * query produces, so a second, subtly different definition of "balance" would
 * make every import look like it had discrepancies.
 *
 * Every step is individually guarded. Backfills reach external price and FX
 * providers, and an import that wrote its rows correctly must not be reported as
 * failed because a quote provider was down.
