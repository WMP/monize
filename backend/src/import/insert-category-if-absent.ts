/**
 * Creates a category unless one with the same name and parent is already
 * there, and reports which of the two happened (INV-IMPORT-003).
 *
 * The callers' pre-checks are a fast path, not a guarantee: `UNIQUE(user_id,
 * name, parent_id)` is what decides, and an import runs as one long
 * transaction, so a unique violation does not merely fail one row -- it aborts
 * the whole import. A user creating "Auto:Fuel" by hand while a Money or QIF
 * import that also needs it is running was enough to lose the import.
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` lets this insert lose and adopt the winner instead;
 * it still waits for a concurrent uncommitted insert of the same key, and only
 * the abort is removed.
 *
 * No conflict target, so it covers the constraint however it is spelled. The
 * constraint does not cover top-level categories (`parent_id` is NULL and NULL
 * never equals NULL), so two of those can still both be created; that is a
 * schema gap, not one this statement can close.
 *
 * The MNY writer (`writeCategories`) and the QIF importer
 * (`ImportService.findOrCreateCategoryDef`) call this;
 * `ImportEntityCreatorService.insertCategoryIfAbsent` is the CSV path's
 * earlier copy of the same statement.
