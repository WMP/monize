/**
 * Lifecycle of a background `.mny` import (design ADR-3).
 *
 * No queue, no Redis, no second process: `POST /import/mny/start` inserts a
 * `pending` row, exactly one worker claims it with a conditional UPDATE, and the
 * body runs as an unawaited in-process task under `withUserContext`. The wizard
 * polls the row.
 *
 * Three things make that safe on Kubernetes, where every replica runs the same
 * code, and it takes all three -- the first two were once described as sufficient
 * and were not:
 *
 * 1. **The claim is atomic**, so two pods racing to start the same job produce
 *    one winner.
 * 2. **A running job heartbeats**, so a job whose pod died is reaped into
 *    `failed` instead of appearing to run forever -- retryable only when
 *    `data_committed` says nothing was written.
 * 3. **The claim mints an `attempt_token` and every worker write requires it.**
 *    Reaping alone decides that a worker is dead; it does not *stop* it. The
 *    heartbeat runs on its own connection while the import transaction runs on
 *    another, so a worker can be blocked past the stale threshold, be written
 *    off, and then wake up. Its commit checkpoint is a fenced compare-and-set on
 *    the token, and a zero-row result throws -- rolling the import back rather
 *    than committing the whole file behind the reaper's back, beside a job row
 *    inviting a retry that would import it again (audit RV4-001).
