 * Microsoft Money 97-99 coded values.

 * Money 2001+ ones: the `TRN.grftt` bits sit in different places and the
 * `TRN.act` table is numbered differently. Where they collide they collide
 * dangerously -- Money 99's loan-template bit is Money Plus's VOID bit, its
 * void bit is Money Plus's loan-account bit, and its SELL is Money Plus's
 * BUY. Nothing here may be read through the Money Plus tables.
 *
 * Every value is **measured** on two hand-built Money 99 (Spanish locale)
 * files, against facts the file settles itself (`LOT.htrnBuy` /
 * `htrnSell`, `TRN_XFER` and `TRN_SPLIT` membership, the account a row sits
 * in) and against the author's own record of what each row was entered as.
 * The files are small, so a real file may still add a bit or a code; the
 * evidence is in `docs/future-plans/mny-money99-import.md`.
