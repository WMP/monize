/**
 * Every byte of `tools/list` rides in the model's context on EVERY request, and
 * the server instructions ride beside it. Nothing measured that, so the payload
 * grew to ~11,600 tokens for 20 tools: each defect fix appended a paragraph, the
 * same fact was stated in the tool description AND the field description AND the
 * instructions, and enum members were spelled out in prose beside the `z.enum`
 * that already carries them.
 *
 * This spec serializes the real `tools/list` through the SDK (the same
 * JSON-Schema conversion a client receives) and fails when a tool, the total, or
 * the instructions exceed their budget. Raising a cap is a reviewed decision,
 * not a fix for a failing build.
 */

// Bytes of serialized JSON per tool in the `tools/list` result, pinned to the
// measured size. A cap is a ratchet: lower it when a tool shrinks, and raise one
// only as a reviewed decision. The whole table dropped ~9% when the server moved
// to the v2 SDK, whose Standard JSON Schema emission is more compact than the
// 1.x converter -- the definitions did not change, so the caps came down with
// the measurement rather than banking the slack.
//
// Raised, as a reviewed decision: `list_accounts` now states every balance in
// the user's default currency beside its own (and names the pairs it could
// not price), and `calculate` gained the `convert` operation -- a currency
// pair and a rate date on the input, the rate and its date on the output. Both
// exist so a model never converts a currency itself, which is worth the bytes.
//
// Raised, as a reviewed decision (owner-approved with the tools): the rule tool
// `manage_transaction_rules` (3,896 bytes: the rule language a model must be
// told to write a condition and its actions, plus the shared A1 field shapes)
// and the review-queue tool `ai_review_requests` (2,981 bytes: four operations
// and the split-line shape of a proposal). Total 51,600 -> 58,480 = the two
// tools (6,877 bytes) plus the previous 72-byte margin; no existing cap moved.
//
// Raised, as a reviewed decision (owner-approved with rule captures, design
// 10.1 and 10.2): `manage_transaction_rules` states the two text actions
// (`set_payee_from_text`, `set_description`) and the `{name}` capture syntax a
// model must be told to write them. 3,896 -> 4,217 bytes (+321); cap 3,950 ->
// 4,250 and total 58,480 -> 58,800 (58,726 measured, the previous margin kept).
//
// Raised, as a reviewed decision (owner-approved with the X3 condition fields,
// design 10.3): the rule language lists five more fields with their operators
// (generated from the field table) and the values a model must write for
// `weekday`, `dayOfMonth`, `status` and the two booleans. 4,217 -> 4,522 bytes
// (+305); cap 4,250 -> 4,560 and total 58,800 -> 59,110 (59,031 measured).
//
// Reshaped, as a reviewed decision (owner-approved, after Claude Code logged
// `description truncated from 2328 to 2048 chars` and the model then guessed
// the rule shape): the rule tool's description is now the contract only (1,877
// characters, under the 2,048 clients keep) and the per-field detail moved into
// the `condition` and `actions` field descriptions, which cost bytes of their
// own. 4,522 -> 4,596 bytes measured (+74); cap 4,560 -> 4,600; the total
// (59,105 measured) stays under 59,110.
//
// Reworded again (owner-approved): the regex advice now says which characters
// are matched literally (`|`, a backslash, `.*`, a short `[xy]` class) and that
// `^`, `$` and longer bracketed words are allowed. 4,596 -> 4,647 bytes
// measured (+51); cap 4,600 -> 4,660; total 59,110 -> 59,170 (59,156 measured).
//
// Reworded for the zero-match fix (owner-approved): the guide now says that
// `conditionMatchedCount` 0 means the rule is wrong while `matchedCount` 0
// beside a matching condition is not an error, and the field descriptions
// regain the true|false, unsigned absAmount and capture-name guidance the
// rewrite dropped. 4,647 -> 4,904 bytes measured (+257); cap 4,660 -> 4,910;
// total 59,170 -> 59,420 (59,413 measured).
//
// Added, as a reviewed decision (email-receipts, "draft a parser with AI"): the
// tool `email_receipt_parsers` (2,606 bytes: three operations and the compact
// parser language a model must be told to write and test a parser from stored
// order emails; its input and output schemas declare only what a model reasons
// about). Total 59,420 -> 62,040 = the new tool plus a 14-byte margin; NO
// existing cap moved, and `ai_review_requests` did not grow to describe the new
// request kind (its claim result carries that guidance).
