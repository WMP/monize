   * killed inside the two-second window, a recalc that throws, a rolling deploy
   * -- leaves snapshots that disagree with the ledger and nothing that will ever
   * notice. A durable work queue would not help: the crash that loses the timer
   * loses the enqueue too, unless the enqueue joins the caller's transaction, and
   * then every write path has to know about net worth.
   *
   * So the staleness is *derived* rather than recorded. Every write that can
   * change a snapshot also touches the account row in the same transaction --
   * usually a `current_balance` delta, and for the one snapshot-only change that
   * moves no balance (a past-dated row shifted to another past month, so the
   * running total is unchanged) an explicit `AccountsService.touchAccount`.
   * Either way `accounts.updated_at` advances, so it is a timestamp the account
   * itself keeps -- and the snapshots are a delete-and-reinsert, so their
   * `updated_at` is when they were last computed. An account whose row is newer
   * than its own snapshots, and whose change is now older than the grace
   * period, was missed (see `STALE_SNAPSHOT_GRACE_MS` for why the grace is an
   * age of the change, not a distance from the old snapshot -- MZ-1242-R5).
   *
   * This is the idempotent-predicate mechanism from `docs/cron-jobs.md`: two
   * replicas racing the sweep recompute the same accounts from scratch, under the
   * per-account lock, and the loser's work is simply redundant. Accounts with no
   * snapshots at all are deliberately not swept -- there is nothing to compare
   * against, and including them would recompute every empty account forever.
   *
   * The lost timer carried two jobs, so the sweep recovers both halves of the
   * seam: after the recompute it re-runs the balance-threshold evaluation the
   * timer would have run (docs/specs/balance-threshold-notifications.md).
   * Re-evaluating is safe because the crossing is a durable latch flipped by a
   * compare-and-set on `accounts.low_alert_armed` / `high_alert_armed`: an
   * account whose timer did fire, or that a racing replica already evaluated,
   * finds the latch already in the state its balance implies and raises
   * nothing. The two halves are isolated from each other exactly as on the
   * timer -- a notification failure never stops the recompute or the sweep,
   * and a failed recompute does not skip the evaluation, which reads the
   * account's committed balance rather than its snapshots.
