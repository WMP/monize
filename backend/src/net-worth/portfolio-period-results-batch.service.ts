 * Every trailing window of the same portfolio, measured once.
 *
 * Every figure is the one `PortfolioPeriodResultService` would have answered
 * for that window: the same value series, the same flow classifier, the same
 * per-day conversion and the same `decidePeriodResult`. What differs is how
 * often the expensive parts run. `getDailyInvestments` rebuilds a portfolio's
 * whole valuation, and the widest window's series already contains every
 * shorter window's points, so this service builds it ONCE for the widest
 * window it reports, loads the per-day flow subtotals and the
 * unmeasurable-movement counts once beside it, and derives each preset by
 * slicing:
 *
 *  - the end boundary is the series' last point, shared by every preset;
 *  - the start boundary is the last point on or before the preset's baseline
 *    (1d, 1w and all report against the previous close) or the first point on
 *    or after the window's start (every other preset);
 *  - the flows and the unmeasurable counts are the days strictly after the
 *    preset's own lower bound, which is exactly what a single-range call with
 *    that bound would have loaded.
 *
 * Slicing rather than recomputing is safe because neither the series nor the
 * rate index depends on how wide a window was asked for: a day is valued from
 * the latest accepted close on or before it, and `buildRateIndex` loads enough
 * rows that a date resolves the same in any window (issue #1390 is the defect
 * that established that). `portfolio-period-results-batch.service.spec.ts`
 * holds the two routes to the same answers on the same fixture, preset by
 * preset -- the "a preview computes what the commit will do" rule, applied to
 * two readers of one measure.
 *
 * A preset whose baseline predates the first point of the series is `null` with
 * `noValueSeries`: a portfolio three days old has no one-year return, and
 * measuring from its first day instead would report a number that looks like
 * one.
 *
 * The LONG windows are not reported that way, because a permanent "n/a" is not
 * an answer anybody can act on. `2y`, `5y` and `10y` are left out of the
 * response entirely unless the scope's history reaches back to them
 * (`isHistoryGatedPreset`), and `all` opens on that history's first day rather
 * than on any arithmetic -- the same day, drawn the same way, as
 * `getInvestedResultSinceInception`. Absence therefore says "this portfolio
 * has no such window"; a window that IS present with null figures was withheld
 * for a cause it names.
