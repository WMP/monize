 * Daily notification of the market-driven change in a user's investment-account
 * value, net of external cash flows -- so a deposit does not fire a false gain
 * and a dividend is return, not a loss
 * (`docs/specs/portfolio-movement-notifications.md`).
 *
 * The measure is `MV(today) - MV(baseline) - externalFlow`: today's portfolio
 * value from `getPortfolioSummary` (holdings + cash, in the reporting currency,
 * with its own completeness flag), the last COMPLETE value the producer stored,
 * and the day's cash that crossed the investment-account boundary from outside.
 * A subtotal is never fired and never becomes a baseline (INV-PORTMOVE-001).
 *
 * Two things make the figure evidence rather than arithmetic. The flow is
 * converted at the date each amount crossed the boundary, never at the run's
 * date (INV-PORTMOVE-007). A position carried at an old close would book its
 * whole catch-up as a market move on the day its new close arrives, so the
 * baseline stores the close and date that valued each held security, and a run
 * in which a close that was already old at the baseline has been replaced
 * restates the baseline at the new close: the catch-up is removed from the
 * movement and named in the alert, and the baseline still advances, so a
 * holding priced by hand never silences the alert (INV-PORTMOVE-008).
 *
 * The withhold policy and the arithmetic live in `decideMovement`
 * (`portfolio-movement.util.ts`), the flow conversion in `foldExternalFlow`
 * (`portfolio-flow.util.ts`) and the late-price rule in `latePriceAdjustment`
 * (`portfolio-price-freshness.util.ts`); all three are pure and unit-tested.
 * This service is the cron plumbing, the flow query and the baseline
 * read-modify-write.
