/**
 * The lookup adapter backed by Google Places.
 *
 * It answers the same question as the AI adapter from a business directory
 * rather than a language model, so its answers need no confidence judgement:
 * every field is a fact Google holds about a listed business, which is why
 * `confidence` is `null` and the sanitizer's per-source trust rules (which
 * withhold an address or phone from an unverified *model* answer) do not
 * apply to it -- `google-places` is not in `UNVERIFIED_CONTACT_LOOKUP_SOURCES`.
 *
 * It has no email. That is the whole reason the AI adapter stays: a directory
 * lookup cannot answer "what address do I write to", and a field Google does
 * not carry is left null rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Not injected with the user's identity or the database: the caller resolves
 * whose key is being spent and whether the quota allowed it, and hands the key
 * down. This class only turns one query into candidates.
