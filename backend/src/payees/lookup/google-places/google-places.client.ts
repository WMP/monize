 * answers "Requests from referer <empty> are blocked" for every lookup. Sending
 * the deployment's own URL makes such a key work.
 *
 * **What it is worth, stated plainly.** A referrer restriction protects a key
 * that is PUBLIC -- shipped inside browser JavaScript, where the browser sets
 * `Referer` and page script cannot forge it. This key is not public: it lives
 * encrypted in the database and never reaches a browser. Anything that can
 * reach Google can send this header too (Node sets it happily; only browsers
 * treat it as forbidden), so the restriction filters nobody who has the key.
 * An IP restriction is the one that actually constrains a server-side key.
 *
 * It is still sent, because a deployment without a stable egress address --
 * a home server on a dynamic IP, a cluster with variable egress -- cannot use
 * an IP restriction at all, and for them a forgeable filter beats no filter.
 * The choice is the operator's; this just stops it being impossible.
 *
 * Only an absolute http(s) URL is sent, reduced to its origin: Google matches
 * patterns like `*.example.com/*`, a path would only narrow what matches, and
 * a malformed value is dropped rather than sent as a header nothing can match.
