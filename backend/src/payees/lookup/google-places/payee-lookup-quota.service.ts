/**
 * The monthly request cap on Google Places lookups, claimed one request at a
 * time.
 *
 * The claim is a single conditional upsert -- mechanism 3 in
 * `docs/concurrency-and-idempotency.md`: the row is created at 1 or
 * incremented, and the `WHERE` refuses to increment past the cap, so the
 * database decides and two replicas racing for the last slot produce one
 * winner. Zero rows back means the cap is reached. A read-then-write would let
 * both callers past a cap of one.
 *
 * **The claim commits before the request goes out** (INV-PAYEE-002). Google
 * bills an attempt whatever comes back, so a slot released because the request
 * then failed would under-count what the user is paying for -- and an
 * under-count is the direction that spends money. `runOutsideActiveScopedManager`
 * is what makes that true even when a caller happens to be inside a
 * transaction: the count of what has been spent must not be rolled back by
 * whatever operation discovered it, exactly as `ProviderHealthService` records
 * an outage outside the request that found it.
 *
 * The month is `to_char(now() AT TIME ZONE $tz, 'YYYY-MM')`, evaluated by
 * PostgreSQL rather than in JavaScript, so every replica rolls over on one
 * clock and no caller can disagree with the row it is incrementing. The zone
 * is `GOOGLE_PLACES_QUOTA_TIMEZONE` -- Pacific, because that is when GOOGLE's
 * free allowance resets, and a counter that rolls over first hands back a cap
 * the allowance behind it has not released yet.
