/**
 * One test that runs the whole production path for a Google Places lookup:
 * the bytes Google sends, through the client, the provider's mapping, the
 * router's source decision, and the coordinator's sanitizing and website
 * vetting -- ending at the `ContactLookupOutcome` a caller actually reads.
 *
 * Every layer here has its own spec, and each passes while the seam between
 * two of them is wrong: the per-layer specs hand each other hand-built
 * objects, so a field the client stops parsing, a mapping that drops one, or
 * a trust rule that blanks it downstream is invisible to all of them. The
 * address is the case that motivated this -- `sanitizeContactSuggestion`
 * withholds address and phone for any source in
 * `UNVERIFIED_CONTACT_LOOKUP_SOURCES`, and a Places answer carries no
 * confidence, so listing `google-places` there (or stamping a candidate with
 * an AI source) silently reduces a directory result to a website and an
 * email, with every other spec still green.
 *
 * The fixture is a real Places response shape, not a minimal one: field names
 * as Google spells them, `displayName` as the `{ text, languageCode }` object
 * rather than a string, and both phone forms present.
