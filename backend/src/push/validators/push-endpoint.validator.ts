/**
 * A push endpoint is a URL the server will make an outbound request to, on a
 * schedule, with a payload -- so it is an SSRF surface, and the comment thread
 * on discussion #1291 named it as one before any alternative transport exists.
 *
 * The private-address, metadata-endpoint, alternate-IP-encoding and
 * DNS-rebinding checks are `validateUrlIsSafe`'s, reused rather than restated:
 * the AI provider `baseUrl` field has needed exactly this since before push
 * did. What is added here is the protocol floor. `validateUrlIsSafe` admits
 * `http:` because a self-hosted model server may be plain HTTP on a LAN; a push
 * endpoint is issued by Mozilla, Google or Apple and is always `https:`, so
 * anything else is a forged value rather than a permissive deployment.
 *
 * The check runs under `validateUrlIsSafeWithin`'s deadline rather than
 * unbounded. It resolves the host, and a resolver that never answers would hold
 * this request -- one an authenticated caller may make twenty times a minute --
 * for the DNS retry budget, before validation has even returned its 400.
