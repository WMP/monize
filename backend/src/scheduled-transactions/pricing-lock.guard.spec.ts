/**
 * The posting prices a loan installment under the lock that authorizes its
 * write (`CONC-001`, INV-LOAN-006).
 *
 * `scheduled-loan-pricing-concurrency.integration.spec.ts` proves the protocol
 * works -- two real connections, a real ledger write queueing behind the held
 * lock. It does not prove the posting *takes* that lock: it drives the protocol,
 * not `post()`. This scan is the other half: every pricing call in the posting
 * path is preceded by the lock.
 *
 * A scan rather than a test of one path because there are two doors into the
 * pricing (the base-split path and the Post dialog's echoed splits), and a
 * third would be added without either existing test noticing.
