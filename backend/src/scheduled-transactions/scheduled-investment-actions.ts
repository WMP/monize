 * Which investment fields a scheduled investment action requires, as data.

 * (`ScheduledTransactionsService.validateInvestmentFields` / `postInvestment`)
 * and the effective-amount resolver (`ScheduledEffectiveAmountService`), which
 * derives what an occurrence would post today from the same fields. They live in
 * their own file so neither imports the other for them.
 *
 * Each Money-vocabulary refinement (REDEEM, CAPITAL_GAIN_SHORT/LONG,
 * REINVEST_*) validates exactly as its base action does.
