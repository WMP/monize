   * The stored split is a template computed when the *previous* occurrence
   * posted; any principal movement committed since (a standalone overpayment, a
   * void, an import) leaves it stale, and no mutation path recalculates it. So
   * the posting path calls this immediately before writing the financial
   * transaction -- inside the same scoped transaction and under the same parent
   * lock -- and posts these amounts instead of the persisted ones. When nothing
   * moved in between, this resolves to exactly what the template already holds.
   *
   * `asOfDate` is the date this occurrence's money actually moves -- the
   * posting date, which an override can move off the recurrence slot -- because
   * that is the date the interest accrues to.
   *
   * The total is the bill the user was shown: this re-divides it between
   * interest and principal and never resizes it (see `InstallmentPurpose`).
   *
   * The decision distinguishes three outcomes, because two of them used to
   * share `null` and a retired loan therefore went on charging its whole stale
   * installment:
   *
   *  - `not-applicable` -- the split set is not a managed loan template, or its
   *    shape is one the recalculation would also decline. The posting proceeds
   *    on the persisted amounts, which is today's behavior.
   *  - `retired` -- it IS a managed template and the debt through `asOfDate` is
   *    already settled, so the correct price is zero: the occurrence is claimed
   *    and the schedule advances, and no financial transaction is written.
   *  - `allocation` -- the interest/principal split to post.
   *
   * **Throws when the ledger cannot be read.** That is not "this is not a loan
   * template": silently declining there would post the stale stored split,
   * which is the exact defect this method exists to prevent, so the occurrence
   * refuses and the whole posting transaction rolls back rather than committing
   * a figure nothing verified.
