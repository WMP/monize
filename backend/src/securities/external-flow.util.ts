/**
 * What "cash crossed the investment boundary" means, in one place.
 *
 * Two surfaces measure a portfolio's movement net of the reader's own
 * contributions -- the daily movement notification
 * (`docs/specs/portfolio-movement-notifications.md`) and the calendar's daily
 * change layer -- and both subtract this figure from a value difference. Two
 * spellings of the predicate would be two different measures wearing one name,
 * so the classification lives here and each caller supplies only its scope and
 * its window.
 *
 * A row counts as external flow when ALL of the following hold:
 *
 *  - its account is in the scope (an investment account, or an explicit id set);
 *  - it is a top-level row (`parent_transaction_id IS NULL`), not a split child
 *    that would double-count its parent;
 *  - it is not VOID -- a void row moved no cash (INV-TRANSFER-001);
 *  - it is not investment-linked, by either representation: a row an
 *    `investment_transactions` record points at, or a parent carrying an
 *    embedded investment split line. Both use the shared exclusions from
 *    `investment-filter.util.ts` rather than a hand-written action list
 *    (INV-REPORT-001, INV-PORTMOVE-006). A hand-rolled copy once joined
 *    `investment_transactions.transaction_split_id` (a `transaction_splits` FK)
 *    against `transactions.id`, a table mismatch that made the split exclusion a
 *    silent no-op;
 *  - it is not a transfer whose counterparty is also in the scope: cash moved
 *    between two scoped accounts never crossed the boundary;
 *  - when the caller names an `investmentScope`, it is not a transfer whose
 *    counterparty is the cash leg of an investment action on one of those
 *    accounts. That is the trade settling inside the portfolio in the shape the
 *    QIF/CSV import writes: the action's cash leg is a transfer row on the
 *    brokerage and its counterpart is the sleeve's cash. A caller drawing the
 *    boundary around the sleeves alone would otherwise read every imported BUY
 *    as a withdrawal and every dividend as a deposit.
 *
 * TWO KNOWN COARSE CASES (INV-PORTMOVE, tracked in the spec's open items), both
 * narrowing rather than corrupting the common path. A caller that subtracts this
 * figure from a value change has to decide what to do about them: the period
 * result counts both per window and withholds its result rather than reporting a
 * difference that is not the market's (`docs/specs/portfolio-period-result.md`
 * section 6.1).
 *
 *  - A split parent that mixes an embedded investment line with an ordinary
 *    external cash line is excluded WHOLE (the sum is over `t.amount`, so it
 *    cannot keep one line and drop another). The line-granular form --
 *    `reportableTransactionAmount`'s dialect -- is a spec-guided follow-up,
 *    because this flow's transfer policy (a transfer OUT of the set counts)
 *    differs from that helper's (it drops all transfers).
 *  - A BUY/SELL funded from an account OUTSIDE the scope (an explicit
 *    `fundingAccountId` on an ordinary account) moves value in with no cash leg
 *    in the scope, so this flow cannot see it and the purchase reads as a market
 *    move. The spec treats BUY/SELL as internal; widening that is a maintainer
 *    decision, not a coded defect.
 *
 * NOTE: verified by unit tests at the fold layer and by asserting the generated
 * SQL here; the classification itself needs the integration environment (a real
 * database with the investment account pair and an embedded-investment split) to
 * confirm end to end.
