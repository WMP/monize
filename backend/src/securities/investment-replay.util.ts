 * direction. Written out per call site the list drifts, and the drift is

 * reducers added a SPLIT's ratio to the share count (10 shares + a 2-for-1
 * ratio = 12) while the holdings service multiplied by it (= 20), so the same

 * centralizing it:
 * - BUY / REINVEST / TRANSFER_IN / ADD_SHARES -- shares acquired, added.
 * - SELL / TRANSFER_OUT / REMOVE_SHARES -- shares disposed of, subtracted.
 * - SPLIT -- a **ratio**, not a share count. The position is multiplied by it,
 *   which is what preserves total cost basis across a split. A 2-for-1 split
 *   carries `quantity = 2`; a 1-for-2 reverse split carries `0.5`.
 * - DIVIDEND / INTEREST / CAPITAL_GAIN / RETURN_OF_CAPITAL -- cash only, no
 *   share movement (a return of capital moves basis instead; see
 *   `applyReturnOfCapital`).
 *
 * A non-positive SPLIT ratio is not applied: it would zero or invert a real
 * position, and a row that cannot say what the split was is not evidence that

 * classification, and it is the one list that decides it:
 *
 * - `capitalIn` -- value entering the invested part. Buying is not earning, so
 *   it must cancel out of the result and enter the base of the return.
 * - `capitalOut` -- value leaving it. Selling is not losing; the proceeds are
 *   what the position came to, and the cash they become earns nothing after.
 * - `income` -- cash the invested part paid out and therefore EARNED. It leaves
 *   as cash and stays in the result.
 * - `reinvestedIncome` -- REINVEST and its refinements: a distribution the
 *   invested part earned and put straight back into shares, the DIVIDEND and
 *   BUY it stands for in one row. A surface prints it in BOTH the income and
 *   the capital figure, so the result they add up to is unchanged; the return
 *   chains read neither, because its shares are already in the day's value and
 *   no value crossed the boundary.
 * - `none` -- SPLIT moves no value (it is a ratio).
 *
 * RETURN_OF_CAPITAL is `capitalOut`: the security pays back part of what was
 * invested in it, so value leaves the invested part as cash without being
 * earned -- the price falls by what was returned, and counting the cash as
 * income would report the same value as a gain it never was.
 *
 * Keyed by BASE action, so a Money-vocabulary refinement cannot fall out of the
 * classification by being forgotten here -- `investedFlowKind` normalizes
 * first. `investment-replay.util.spec.ts` holds every `InvestmentAction` member
 * to a kind, so a new action is a failing test rather than a silent zero in a
