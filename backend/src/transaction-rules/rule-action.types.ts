/**
 * The closed list of rule actions (design section 6.1). INV-RULE-001 (restated
 * in docs/specs/transaction-rules-structural-actions.md section 2): no action
 * changes the matched row's amount, account, date or status, and none deletes
 * or relinks a row that exists. The only balance a rule moves is the one a
 * structural action (`convert_to_transfer`, `split`,
 * `settle_loan_installment`) creates, by exactly the counterpart leg's
 * amount. Anything not in this union is not representable, and the validator
 * refuses it.
 *
 * `request_ai_review` is the one action that is not a ledger write: it asks
 * for a person-approved AI review of the row and never changes the row itself.
 * `isLedgerAction` tells the two groups apart for the applier;
 * `isStructuralAction` picks out the three that restructure the row.
 *
 * `RULE_ACTION_TYPES` is the list the frontend editor mirrors
 * (`frontend/src/lib/rule-fields.contract.test.ts`) and the hints and name
 * mappings are keyed on. Every save path accepts it plus
 * `settle_loan_installment` (`isAcceptedActionType` in `rule-validation.ts`):
 * the action is typed, validated, referenced, planned and, since its write
 * path landed (B5 of `docs/future-plans/loan-installment-settlement-tasks.md`),
 * written with its occurrence claim, but it joins the mirrored list only with
 * the editor card that offers it (F1), so until then a rule carrying it is
 * written by hand, by the mortgage form (B7), the assistant or MCP (B8).
