 * `evaluateRuleConditionWithCaptures` of that leaf, and a group combines its
 * children's results the way the evaluator does (`all` of nothing is true,

 * `evaluateRuleCondition(node, facts)` and its captures equal the captures of
 * `evaluateRuleConditionWithCaptures`, which the spec holds over every
 * condition fixture of the evaluator's own specs. Unlike the evaluator it does
 * not stop at the first child that decides a group: every child is explained,
 * because the reader wants to see which leaf failed.
 *
 * The output is bounded by the validator's own limits: a group below
 * `MAX_RULE_CONDITION_DEPTH`, or any node beyond `MAX_RULE_CONDITION_NODES` nodes, is
 * reported as `omitted` with its answer.
