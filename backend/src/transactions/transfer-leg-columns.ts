 * What a transfer's two legs hold, derived once from a `PreparedTransfer`.
 *
 * `writeTransferLegs` creates both rows from this, and the in-place conversion
 * of an existing row (`TransactionConversionService.convertToTransfer`) writes
 * the kept row with its side and creates the other from this same set, so a
 * converted row carries exactly what a created leg would (spec
 * `docs/specs/transaction-transfer-conversion.md`). A second hand-written
 * column list beside the create's is how a converted leg would drift from a
 * created one.
 *
 * Every nullable column is written explicitly (`null`, never `undefined`): on a
 * create the two are the same stored value, and on a conversion the kept row's
 * old value must be replaced, not kept because the key was skipped. The
 * `externalId` is deliberately not here: it names the row that a create wrote
 * and stays on it through a conversion; `writeTransferLegs` adds it to the
 * source leg it creates.
