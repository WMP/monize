 * 6.7), once a day at 06:17 UTC. A warranty is reminded of when 30, 7 and 0
 * days remain, in the owner's timezone; nothing fires after the day of expiry.
 *
 * **A reminder fires on reaching a threshold, once per expiry date, never on
 * mere observation.** The threshold owed is the smallest mark the days left are
 * at or under (`warrantyReminderThreshold`), so a missed run moves the next one
 * to a smaller mark instead of firing the skipped ones in a burst.
 *
 * **Every replica fires every cron, so the dedupe key is the claim (WTY-004).**
 * A notification's `dedupeKey` names the warranty, its `expires_on` and the
 * mark; `NotificationService.create` is an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
 * over `idx_notifications_dedupe`, so one replica wins each reminder and the
 * other gets `null` and sends nothing. A changed `expires_on` forms new keys,
 * so the reminders fire again for the new date.
 *
 * The shape is the ordinary out-of-request one: `withSystemContext` for the
 * cross-user read, `withUserContext(userId)` around each user's whole body, a
 * failure of one warranty or one user logged and the loop continues. A user
 * with no resolvable timezone counts in UTC.
