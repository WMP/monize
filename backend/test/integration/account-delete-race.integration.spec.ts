/**
 * A26-M19 (A26-S10-03): deleting an account counted its transactions in one
 * transaction and removed it in another, so a bank sync or import that wrote
 * into the account in between had its rows cascaded away with it, and their
 * transfer legs in other accounts were left one-sided.
 *
 * Connection 1 (the gate) is the writer: it holds the account's row lock and
 * inserts a row, as the sync writer does. Connection 2 is the delete. Once the
 * delete is parked on that lock the writer commits; the delete must then see
 * the row and refuse.
