/**
 * INV-PAYEE-002 -- the two-connection proof.
 *
 * The claim is that the number of Google Places requests made in one BILLING
 * month -- Pacific, the zone Google's free allowance resets in -- never exceeds
 * the cap for the key's owner. A unit spec can only assert
 * the SQL string; whether the statement actually refuses a concurrent second
 * claimant is a property of PostgreSQL, and only a real database can answer it.
 *
 * The interleaving needs no barrier here, and that is worth stating rather than
 * assuming. The mechanism is a single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ...
 * WHERE`, so each claimant's read and write are one statement: the second one
 * blocks on the first's row lock inside the statement and re-evaluates the
 * `WHERE` against the committed value. There is no window between a read and a
 * write for a barrier to hold open -- which is precisely the property being
 * tested, and why a read-then-write implementation would fail this spec even
 * under a plain `Promise.all`.
