/**
 * CONC-001 for the scheduled loan installment (issue #1253, INV-LOAN-006).
 *
 * The occurrence's interest is `debt(d) x rate`, and that debt is an aggregate
 * over `transactions`. Reading it inside the posting transaction is not enough:
 * no ledger writer takes the scheduled-transaction row lock, so under READ
 * COMMITTED a principal payment can commit between the debt `SELECT` and the
 * posting's own write, and the split is then priced from a balance that was
 * already stale when it was written.
 *
 * `lockAccountsForBalanceWrite` is what closes that window, and this suite
 * proves it does -- with two real connections, because blocking is a property
 * of PostgreSQL and a mock cannot demonstrate it
 * (`docs/verification-contract.md`).
 *
 * **What this suite reaches, and what it does not.** This suite was written
 * while the integration harness replaced `ScheduledTransactionsModule` with a
 * stub, so it does not call the real `ScheduledTransactionsService.post()`
 * (the harness now builds the real module). It proves the *protocol*: that holding the pricing lock
 * across the debt read forces a real, production-path ledger write to queue
 * behind it. That the posting path actually takes that lock before it prices is
 * held by `pricing-lock.guard.spec.ts`, which scans the posting source. Neither
 * half is sufficient alone and the pair is stated here so a future reader does
 * not mistake one for both.
