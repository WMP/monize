 * horizontal-scaling defects were invisible for so long
 * (`docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling.md`). These tests are the only place
 * in the repository where a second replica actually answers a browser, so they
 * are the only place a regression to process-local state shows up as a failing
 * user-visible outcome rather than as an integration test about a table.
 *
 * Run only against the two-replica stack (`docker-compose.e2e.yml`, profile
 * `cluster`), which the CI shard starts and sets `E2E_CLUSTER=multi` for.
 * Skipped everywhere else, including the other three shards: against one
 * backend every assertion below is true for the wrong reason.

 * dependency to make three calls would be the tail wagging the dog. The two

 * `MCP-Protocol-Version` header naming the same revision as the envelope are
 * what the transport validates; `docs/backend/mcp.md` describes the same wire,
 * and `mcp-eras.spec.ts` drives it through the real SDK.
 *
 * The stateless leg is also the only one that can be used here at all: a
 * 2025-era session is pinned to the replica that created it
 * (`docs/adr/0004-mcp-two-eras-request-identity-and-mrtr-confirmation.md`), so
 * a round-robin LB would answer its second request `404 Session not found`.
