# Frontend Directory

Next.js App Router application (React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand, react-hook-form + Zod, next-intl, Vitest). All commands run from this directory.

This file is an index. The rules themselves live in `docs/frontend/` (start at `docs/frontend/README.md`) and are read when the work touches their subject. Most of them are also enforced by a source-scanning test whose failure message names the thing to use, so a rule is met by fixing the code, never by widening a guard's baseline or its allowlist.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev                # Dev server (port 3000)
npm run build              # Production build (standalone output for Docker)
npm run lint               # ESLint
npm run type-check         # tsc --noEmit
npm run test               # Vitest (single run)
npm run test:changed       # Tests related to changes since origin/main plus every guard; prints failures only; no coverage
npm run test:watch         # Vitest (watch mode)
npm run test:cov           # Coverage report (91% lines, 90% stmts, 87% funcs, 85% branches)
npm run i18n:pseudo        # Regenerate the xx pseudo-locale from en
npm run i18n:check         # Verify the pseudo-locale is up to date (CI gate)
```

## Layout

`src/` is organized by feature under `app/` and `components/` (shared primitives in `components/ui/`), with `lib/` for API clients and pure utilities, `store/` for Zustand, `test/` for the shared test harness and `proxy.ts` for the Next middleware. Use the filesystem or LSP `workspaceSymbol` for anything more specific.

## Configuration

- **Path alias:** `@/*` maps to `src/*` (tsconfig + Vitest resolve alias).
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** utilities compile to `var(--color-*)`; theme variables live in the `globals.css` `@theme` block and colour themes in `src/app/themes.css`.
- **Next.js:** standalone output (Docker); security headers and the CSP nonce come from `next.config.js` and `src/proxy.ts` (Next middleware, not this project's deprecated middleware pattern).

## Rules that apply to every change

**Find how the codebase already does it and do it the same way.** Each of these exists once; the generic version looks fine in isolation and wrong in place. `src/test/ui-conventions.test.ts` and the guard tests named in `docs/frontend/` fail on most of the hand-rolled versions.

| Need | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Panel card | `Card` / `CARD_CLASS` (`components/ui/Card.tsx`) | an inline `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow` trio |
| Dialog | `Modal` with `title` (`components/ui/Modal.tsx`) | a hand-rolled heading or overlay |
| Status pill / table chrome | `Badge`; `Th`/`Td` and the constants in `components/ui/Table.tsx` | a hand-rolled pill or `<th>` class string |
| Empty list | `EmptyState` | a `text-center py-12` block |
| Date entry | `DateInput` | a raw `<input type="date">` |
| Money entry / other numbers | `CurrencyInput` / `NumericInput` | any `type="number"` input; `parseFloat` on typed text |
| Number a person reads | `useNumberFormat()` (`formatCurrency`, `formatNumber`, `formatPercent`, `formatShareQuantity`, `formatBytes`) | `toFixed`, `toLocaleString()`, the raw `@/lib/format` helpers, a literal `%` |
| Rounding, a bound, an id check, a foreign ISO code | `roundToCents` / `roundMoney` / `sumMoney` / `withCurrencyCode` (`lib/format.ts`), `clamp` (`lib/clamp.ts`), `isUuid` (`lib/uuid.ts`) | a local `round2`, `clamp` or UUID regex, or a component's own `formatCurrency` |
| Today, for a financial decision | `useFinancialToday()` / `financialTodayYmd` | `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` |
| Help that explains a figure or setting | `InfoTooltip` (opens on hover, focus and tap) | a hand-rolled `role="tooltip"`, or a help icon hidden below a breakpoint |
| Clickable table row | `useLongPress({ onClick })` spread on the `<tr>` | a button around the name |
| Category colour and icon | `CategoryGlyph`, `CategoryPill`, `buildCategoryIconMap` / `buildCategoryColorMap` | reading `category.icon` or interpolating it into text |
| Brand favicon | `InstitutionLogo` / `PayeeLogo` over `BrandLogo` | a third-party favicon URL |
| Row density | `useDensityPreference(view)` and `DensityToggle` | a local density `useState` or a second store |
| Scheduled occurrence amount, date, account | `nextOccurrenceEffectiveAmount`, `nextOccurrenceDueDate`, `occurrenceSettlementAccountId` (`lib/scheduled-effective-amount.ts`) | `nextOverride?.amount ?? amount`, `nextDueDate`, `st.accountId` |
| Reporting currency fallback | `preferredCurrency` (`lib/default-currency.ts`) | `pref?.defaultCurrency \|\| 'USD'` |
| A portfolio chart's window and opening point | `usePortfolioRangeWindow` (`start` for the series, `periodStart` for the period) and `openingSessionDate` for the first label | `resolveRangePreset`, a lookback of your own, a first point dated by a day the market was shut |
| An investment row's money | the row's own `amountCurrencyCode` / `priceCurrencyCode` / `commissionCurrencyCode` | the account's currency, the reader's, or a client-side sum across rows |
| CSV | `exportToCsv` / `exportCsvSections` (`lib/csv-export.ts`) | a second `text/csv` Blob |
| Random id | `crypto.randomUUID()` | `Math.random()` |
| Chart colour | `chartColors` tokens (`lib/chart-colors.ts`) | a hex literal in a `fill`, `stroke` or `stopColor` |
| Widget title that opens the fuller view | `titleHref` on `WidgetCard`, `href` on `WidgetHeading` | a button or link hand-rolled around the heading |
| Month grid | `MonthGrid` + `monthGridDays` (`lib/calendar-month.ts`); occurrence placement stays `buildScheduledCalendarDays` + `ScheduledCalendarGrid` until the bills grid migrates | a third month grid, or a `Date` built from a calendar date |
| Table / Calendar choice for a screen | `useViewMode(surface)` (`store/viewModeStore.ts`) and `ViewModeToggle` | a local `useState`, a second store or a URL parameter |
| Segmented control (a pill of buttons, one pressed) | `SEGMENTED_GROUP_CLASS` + `segmentClass` (`components/ui/segmented-control.ts`) | a local `BUTTON_BASE`/`BUTTON_ACTIVE` trio, or the pressed classes inlined |
| Switcher in a dashboard widget header | `WidgetSegmentedControl` (`components/dashboard/`), an `icon` option where two must share the line | a toolbar pill beside it, or a wrapping second row |
| A dashboard widget's breakdown of the ledger | the report's own endpoint through `builtInReportsApi` | summing transactions in the widget |
| Report refresh / export buttons | `ReportToolbarActions`, last child of the toolbar row | rendering `ExportDropdown` or `RefreshPricesButton` in a report |
| A dashboard card filling its grid row | the grid's own `stretch` plus the card's min-height | `h-full` on a widget's outermost element |
| Toolbar row on a phone | `flex-wrap`, `w-full sm:w-auto`, `sm:ml-auto`, a button's height from `items-stretch` + `LabelSpacer` | an unwrapped row, a bare `ml-auto`, a hand-matched padding |
| A register's running balance | `walkRunningBalances` (`lib/running-balance.ts`) over the response's `startingBalance` | a second walk in a component, or a balance drawn under a sort other than date |
| Category filter pseudo-ids (`uncategorized`, `transfer`, `income`, `expense`) | `SPECIAL_CATEGORY_FILTER_IDS`, `canonicalizeCategoryFilter`, `useCategoryFilterLabels` (`lib/categoryUtils.ts`) | a literal pseudo-id check, or a type sent as its enumerated ids |

**A write that moves money calls `invalidateBalanceCaches()`** (or `clearAllCache()` where the write can touch anything). `src/lib/balance-cache.guard.test.ts` scans for the omission.

**Asynchronous data belongs to the request that produced it.** Keep the payload with its request key, adopt a mutation's response only when its origin still matches the current selection, and never render a failed lookup as an empty result (`accounts = []`, `interest = []`, a total of zero). `docs/frontend/api-and-cache.md` has the rule and the regression matrix.

**An unknown value is `null` and renders as unknown; a known zero renders as a number.** Never `?? 0`, `|| 0` or `?? 1` on an API value, never `connectNulls` by default, and never `> 0` or truthiness where `0` is a legitimate value. Decide which of the two states a branch is in before writing it.

**Every user-facing string is translated.** `useTranslations('namespace')`; catalogs in `src/i18n/messages/{locale}/{namespace}.json`, new namespaces registered in `src/i18n/messages.ts`. Develop English-first and run `npm run i18n:pseudo`; translate every other locale as the final commit on the PR (`src/i18n/messages.parity.test.ts`). Compose punctuation in the catalog, not in JSX, and never write `--` in copy. Full flow: `src/i18n/messages/README.md`.

**Components:** interactive components are `'use client'`; server components are the default for pages and layouts. No `setState` in `useEffect` (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`); reset child state from a prop with the "info from previous render" pattern. Nothing interactive goes inside a `<button>` or an `<a>`. Focus rings are `focus-visible:`; transitions carry `motion-reduce:transition-none`.

**Tests** import `render` and `renderHook` from `@/test/render`, never from `@testing-library/react`; wrap a render or interaction that fetches in `await act(async () => ...)`; spread `numberFormatMockDefaults()` into any `useNumberFormat` mock; mock a module you only partly want with `importOriginal`. An act() warning or a missing message fails the test.

## Read when the work touches it

| Work | Read |
|---|---|
| API calls, caching, asynchronous state, ownership of joint accounts | `docs/frontend/api-and-cache.md` |
| Cards, dialogs, pickers, switchers, rows, links, attachments, tours, settings screens, report toolbars | `docs/frontend/ui-conventions.md` |
| Inputs, number and date formatting, phone numbers, text caps, CSV, form modals | `docs/frontend/forms-and-formatting.md` |
| Tables, registers, density, pagination, phones | `docs/frontend/tables-and-registers.md` |
| Money figures: scheduled occurrences, loans, portfolio ranges, chart reductions, unknown values | `docs/frontend/financial-figures.md`, then `docs/financial-semantics.md`, `docs/time-series-contract.md`, `docs/system-invariants.md` |
| Push, service worker, Web Share Target | `docs/frontend/pwa-push-share.md` |
| Tests, mocks, harness | `docs/frontend/testing.md` and `docs/testing-contract.md` |
| Theme, palettes, chart colours | `docs/frontend/theming.md` |

Do not invent or duplicate financial semantics in a component. Where a figure is derived, the derivation lives once in `lib/` and every surface reads it; `docs/frontend/financial-figures.md` names the helper for each one.

## Security Notes

- **Zod** runs with `jitless: true` (`zodConfig.ts`) for CSP compliance -- no `new Function()`; ESLint `no-new-func: error`.
- **Auth tokens** live in httpOnly cookies managed by the backend, never in JS-accessible storage.
- **localStorage is readable by any XSS.** A store that persists there is listed in `src/store/persisted-storage.guard.test.ts` with the reason its contents may sit in storage, and the pre-login footprint is pinned there byte for byte.
- **CSP:** per-request nonce generated in `src/proxy.ts`, `strict-dynamic` for `script-src`.

## Before you finish

Run the focused test for what you changed while developing, then:

1. `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run i18n:check`
2. `npm run test:cov` (CI runs the coverage thresholds, not a bare `npm run test`)
3. `npm run build` (bundle size is checked on every PR)
4. `node scripts/check-env-docs.mjs` from the repository root when a `process.env` read was added

Deleting or renaming a control an E2E spec drives means grepping `e2e/` for its accessible name in the same commit -- `npm run test` never loads that suite.
