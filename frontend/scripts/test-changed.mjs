/**
 * `npm run test:changed` runs the Vitest files a change can affect, and prints
 * only the failures. It is the loop an agent runs while it works; the full
 * `test:cov` gate stays the one CI runs before merge.
 *
 * One `vitest related` run takes two lists as its "changed files":
 *  - every file that differs from the merge base with the base ref, in the
 *    working tree or untracked, and
 *  - every guard test. A guard scans source text rather than importing the code
 *    it protects, so the import graph never selects it. The union is also never
 *    empty, so no zero-discovery flag is needed (REL-001).
 *
 * The `dot` reporter prints one character per test and the full message of each
 * failure; `--silent` drops console output. Coverage is off: a threshold means
 * nothing over a subset. The base is `origin/main`; set `TEST_CHANGED_BASE` to
 * change it.
