 * whether the last point may be read as a projection, and whether the
 * unavailable panel renders. It is one field because the two views each derived
 * it twice from two different things: `complete === false` at the point of
 * loading, and `gaps.length > 0` at the point of rendering. Those agree only
 * while the server names a cause for every withheld forecast; a response that
 * withholds without naming one (an unrecognised gap reason, a narrowed payload,
 * a future server that reports incompleteness it cannot attribute) made
 * `gaps.length > 0` false, and then the panel did not render AND the projected
 * balance fell back to the account's CURRENT balance -- today's figure printed
 * under "Projected", with nothing on screen saying so. Exactly the trap issue
 * #1247 exists to close, reintroduced by asking the question twice.
 *
 * `gaps` explains the withholding; it never decides it.
