/**
 * Which repair a withheld period figure points the reader at.
 *
 * The marker carries one `UnknownAmount` cause and the server sends five, so
 * the mapping is made here rather than guessed -- the same decision
 * `movementUnknownReason` makes for a day's movement, for the same reason: an
 * unpriced holding is a price to add, a cash account with no balance is neither
 * a price nor a rate, an unconvertible amount is a rate to refresh, and a
 * boundary is nothing anybody can fix. Naming a price for a missing display
 * rate sends the reader to a screen where there is nothing to do.
 *
 * `zeroStart` and `noValueSeries` are both boundaries: a period that started at
 * nothing has no percentage to report, and a scope that produced no valued day
 * has nothing to compare. Neither is a defect to repair.
 *
 * `mwrUndefined` and `windowTooShort` are causes of the money-weighted return
 * alone and fall through to `noBaseline` for the same reason `zeroStart` does:
 * a window too short to annualise, or a schedule of flows with no single rate,
 * is a boundary rather than a price, a rate or a balance anybody can repair.
 *
 * `externallySettledTrade` and `mixedSplit` fall to the same marker for want of
 * a truer one: nothing is missing from the data, so naming a price, a rate or a
 * balance would send the reader to a screen with nothing to do on it. They
 * withhold only the ACCOUNT result; the invested figures every card shows do
 * not read where a trade's cash settled (#1516).
