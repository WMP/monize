/**
 * The chrome for a segmented control: a pill holding two or more buttons where
 * exactly one is pressed.
 *
 * Written once because the controls sit beside each other. The Investments
 * toolbar carries the brokerage/cash switch and the Table/Calendar switch in
 * one row, and a second styling of the same idea reads as two different kinds
 * of switch. `ViewModeToggle` was a copy of `InvestmentViewToggle`'s classes
 * and had already drifted: only the copy carried
 * `motion-reduce:transition-none`, so a reader who asked for reduced motion got
 * one switch that animated and one that did not.
 *
 * Constants rather than a `<SegmentedControl>` component, for the reason
 * `interactive-row.ts` and `lib/scheduled-kind.ts` are: each control names its
 * own options, labels them from its own namespace and reports a different
 * union, so the shared part is the appearance and nothing else. Tailwind v4's
 * automatic source detection covers `.ts`, which is what makes a class
 * constant outside a component safe.
