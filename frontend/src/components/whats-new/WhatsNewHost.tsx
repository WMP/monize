/**
 * Drives the "What's New" release-notes modal. Mounted once in the root layout
 * so it is present on every route, including the login screen.
 *
 * On load it fetches the current version's notes: authenticated users get the
 * per-user status (the backend suppresses it for acknowledged versions,
 * disabled preference, and demo instances); unauthenticated visitors get the
 * public notes so the login screen's version label can still open the modal
 * manually.
 *
 * The modal auto-opens only when the backend says the user is due this version
 * *and* this page load is a moment to deliver it: either it followed a login
 * (`markWhatsNewPendingForLogin`), or the version is one this browser has not
 * announced yet (`recordAnnouncedVersion`), which covers a deploy landing under
 * a session that never logs out. The backend status alone is version-scoped,
 * not session-scoped, so gating on it alone reopened the modal on every refresh
 * until acknowledged.
 *
 * It never auto-opens on a public route (`isPublicPath`): those screens tell
 * the visitor they are signed out, so a signed-in digest over them contradicts
 * the page. The triggers are left armed there and spent once the user reaches
 * the app. The manual open from the version label still works, in its
 * signed-out variant.
