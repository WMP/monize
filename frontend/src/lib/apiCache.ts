/**
 * Drop every cached view of a balance. Call this from any write that moves
 * money -- posting a scheduled transaction, editing a split, an investment
 * trade, an import -- not just the ones that go through `transactionsApi`.
 *
 * `accountsApi.getAll` caches for two minutes and the backend computes the
 * balance live from transactions, so a write that skips this leaves the
 * Accounts page showing the pre-write number until the entry ages out or the
 * browser reloads. Navigating back to the page does not help: the page
 * refetches on mount and the refetch is served from this cache.
 *
 * The prefixes go together because an account balance, a portfolio value and a
 * budget's progress are three views of the same rows: a trade moves the
 * INVESTMENT_CASH balance, a split transfer moves an account the parent
 * transaction never named, and any categorised amount moves the budget it falls
 * in. `budgets:dashboard` caches for 30 seconds and `budgets:cat-status:*` for
 * 60, so leaving them behind means the write succeeds and the progress bar
 * beside it still shows the pre-write remaining amount -- which is the number a
 * user makes the next spending decision from.
 *
 * It is also called by writes that change a valuation input that is not a
 * ledger row -- a stored price, a security's currency, an exchange rate -- and
 * by recategorising writes (a category reassignment, a payee default category
 * applied to existing rows), because every converted total and every budget
 * roll-up is derived from them.
 *
 * Anything derived from transaction rows belongs on this list, including a
 * warranty's `linkedTransaction` (the purchase's date, payee and amount). Adding a new
 * cached family that reads them means adding its prefix here in the same
 * change; `balance-cache.guard.test.ts` holds the call sites, and
 * `apiCache.test.ts` holds the prefix set.
