/**
 * Goal-seek helpers for the overpayment simulator: given a target (a total
 * interest cost, or a payoff month), find the smallest recurring extra payment
 * that reaches it. Both targets are monotonic in the recurring amount -- more
 * extra per period means less total interest and an earlier payoff -- so a
 * binary search converges reliably.
 *
 * A target is only "met" by a schedule that actually paid off inside the
 * projection horizon: a truncated schedule has accumulated less interest than
 * the loan really costs, so it satisfies any interest target by being
 * incomplete. `meetsInterestTarget` is that predicate, and a baseline that did
 * not pay off yields `baseline-incomplete` rather than a saving measured against
 * a subtotal.
 *
 * The recurring amount is the knob because it is the natural "how much should I
 * overpay every month" answer. The mode is SHORTEN_TERM: paying off sooner (and
 * paying less interest) is only meaningful when the extra shortens the term;
 * LOWER_INSTALLMENT keeps the end date, so it cannot hit a payoff-date target.
