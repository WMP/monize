# Monize Helm Chart

A Helm chart for deploying the Monize personal finance application on Kubernetes.

## Architecture

Monize is a two-tier application:
- **Backend**: Node.js API server (port 3001) connected to a PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: Web application (port 3000) that communicates with the backend internally

Only the frontend is exposed externally via HTTPRoute or Ingress. The backend is accessible only within the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.27+
- Helm 3.x
- Either a Gateway API implementation (e.g., Cilium) **or** an Ingress controller

## Installation

```bash
# Install with default values (HTTPRoute enabled)
helm install monize ./helm -n monize --create-namespace

# Install with Ingress instead of HTTPRoute
helm install monize ./helm -n monize --create-namespace \
  --set httpRoute.enabled=false \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.className=nginx

# Dry-run to preview rendered templates
helm template monize ./helm -n monize
```

## Routing Options

This chart supports two mutually exclusive routing strategies:

### HTTPRoute (Gateway API) - Default

Enabled by default. Uses the Kubernetes Gateway API with a Cilium TLS gateway.

```yaml
httpRoute:
  enabled: true
  parentRefs:
    - name: tls
      namespace: cilium
      sectionName: https
```

### Ingress (Traditional)

For clusters using a traditional Ingress controller (nginx, traefik, etc.):

```yaml
httpRoute:
  enabled: false

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  tls:
    - secretName: monize-tls
      hosts:
        - monize.yourdomain.com
```

> **Note**: Both can technically be enabled simultaneously, but it is recommended to only enable one.

### MCP sessions and more than one backend replica

The MCP endpoint serves two protocol revisions. The 2026-07-28 one is stateless
per request and runs on any number of replicas as it is. The 2025-era one -- what
Claude Desktop's connector, `claude mcp add` and Codex negotiate today -- opens a
session that lives in **one backend process**, and that session cannot be moved:
the SDK offers no way to restore a session id into a new transport, and the live
state of an exchange is the open response stream and the pending write
confirmation held by the replica that answered `initialize`.

With `backend.replicas: 1` (the default) there is nothing to configure. Raising
it while 2025-era clients connect needs this:

```yaml
mcp:
  stickySessions:
    enabled: true
```

That renders a route for `/api/v1/mcp` straight to the backend Service, asking
the edge to pin each session to one replica -- an `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity`
Ingress of its own when `ingress.enabled` is set, and an HTTPRoute rule carrying
`sessionPersistence` when `httpRoute.enabled` is. The route bypasses the frontend
on purpose: every other path is served by the frontend, which proxies to
`monize-backend-service` with a server-side fetch, so affinity at the edge would
pin the frontend pod while kube-proxy still spread that fetch across backend
replicas.

Three limits to know before relying on it:

- **It pins by cookie, so it pins only clients that keep cookies.** A client that
  discards them is spread across replicas as before.
- **Gateway API `sessionPersistence` is an experimental-channel field.** Install
  the experimental CRDs and confirm your implementation honours it; otherwise the
  rule is admitted and does nothing.
- **It covers the documented URL, `https://<host>/api/v1/mcp`.** A client pointed
  at the bare origin is recognised by its headers inside the frontend proxy,
  which no path-matching route can reproduce.

Where none of that holds, the two configurations that work are one backend
replica, or clients that speak 2026-07-28. Without stickiness a misrouted session
id is answered `404`, which the spec requires a client to recover from by
re-initializing: reads recover, but a write confirmation in flight does not --
its answer never reaches the replica that asked, that replica's wait expires, and
the write proceeds under the client's own approval prompt.

#### Memory for Microsoft Money imports

The default `backend.resources.limits.memory` of `400Mi` is sized for ordinary
use and **cannot import a real `.mny` file** at the default
`MNY_IMPORT_LIMIT_MB`. A Money upload is buffered in
memory and decrypted in place, so peak usage is roughly twice the file size on
top of the baseline. A pod that hits its limit mid-import is OOM-killed, and the
wizard reports the job as stalled rather than as out of memory.

Set the limit to at least `2 x MNY_IMPORT_LIMIT_MB + 200Mi`:

| `MNY_IMPORT_LIMIT_MB` | Suggested `backend.resources.limits.memory` |
|---|---|
| `50` | `300Mi` |
| `100` | `400Mi` |
| `300` (default) | `1Gi` |

Lowering `MNY_IMPORT_LIMIT_MB` is the cheaper option when the files being
imported are small: the wizard then rejects an oversized file with a clear
message before any memory is committed to it.

#### Memory for backups and restores

Three backup paths cannot stream, so each holds a whole payload in memory: the
encrypted export and the automatic export (AES-GCM needs the entire plaintext to
compute its auth tag), the support export (it needs every table at once to
reconcile scaled balances), and a restore (it must decompress and parse the file
before it can validate it).

Each of those holds **several copies at peak** — per-table JSON strings, the
concatenated buffer, the gzip output, the parsed object graph — so a ceiling has
to be a fraction of `resources.limits.memory`, not close to it. A ceiling larger
than the container's limit is not a ceiling at all: the pod is OOM-killed before
the request can be refused, which leaves no artifact and no error the user can
read, only a restart.

That is not hypothetical. These defaulted to `1024mb` and `512mb` against this
chart's `400Mi` backend, so neither could ever fire.

Leave `backend.backupLimits` empty and the backend derives each ceiling from the
container's cgroup memory limit, which tracks whatever you set above. Set them when
you have measured your own deployment — the backend logs a warning at startup when
a configured value is too large to protect the process it is running in.

`exportBuffer` is roughly a quarter of the limit:

| `backend.resources.limits.memory` | Derived ceiling per buffered export |
|---|---|
| `256Mi` | `64Mi` (the floor) |
| `400Mi` (default) | `100Mi` |
| `1Gi` | `256Mi` |
| `4Gi` | `1Gi` (the cap) |

**The restore ceilings are smaller, and they are measured rather than assumed.**
Measured (issue #1073), a restore's peak memory is about **6.1× its expanded payload
plus a fixed 78Mi** — the fixed part being zlib's windows and the heap V8 grows to
parse and rewrite a document at all. The model previously assumed three times the
payload and no fixed part, which admitted restores the process could not finish. So
`restoreExpanded` is solved out of what the container has left rather than taken as a
share of it: the limit, minus the ordinary process baseline (`max(140Mi, a fifth)`),
less a 15% margin, minus the fixed cost, divided by 6.1. `restoreUpload` follows it,
because gzip output is never smaller than what it expands to.

| `backend.resources.limits.memory` | Largest restorable artifact | Concurrent restores |
|---|---|---|
| `200Mi` and below | none — restores refused with a 503 | 0 |
| `256Mi` | ~3Mi | 1 |
| `400Mi` (default) | ~23Mi | 1 |
| `1Gi` | ~101Mi | 1 |
| `8Gi` | ~903Mi | 1 |

**A pod that leaves less than about 78Mi free after the baseline cannot restore at
all**, however small the backup, because the fixed cost is spent before the first
byte of payload. That is a refusal with a message naming the lever, not an OOM kill
mid-restore.

A bigger pod otherwise buys a bigger artifact rather than a second concurrent
restore. If you would rather have concurrency, set `restoreExpanded` lower yourself —
though each concurrent restore pays the fixed 78Mi again, so the slot count grows
more slowly than the ceiling shrinks. And if a real backup is being refused, raise
`resources.limits.memory`: raising `restoreUpload` alone gets you an OOM-killed pod
instead of a refusal, which is the failure the ceiling exists to prevent.

A user whose dataset exceeds the ceiling gets a readable refusal naming the size
and the limit. For the support export they can also narrow it with an account
selection or a date range. If real exports are being refused, raise the memory
limit **and** the ceiling: raising either alone achieves nothing.

**A restore upload needs a ticket, and the ingress should have a body limit.**
The backend's upload admission has to run in front of its body parser, which is in
front of every guard — so it cannot authenticate the request whose memory it is
budgeting for. Since Monize 1.16 it does not have to: the client first asks
`POST /api/v1/backup/restore/ticket` (ordinary authenticated JSON) for a short-lived
signed ticket, and an upload without one is refused `403` before a byte is buffered.
Nothing to configure — it is on whenever `JWT_SECRET` is set, which is always.

What the chart cannot do for you is stop that traffic before it reaches the pod. If
you terminate with an Ingress, set a body-size limit on it to match your
`backupLimits.restoreUpload` (nginx: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size`;
Traefik: a `buffering` middleware with `maxRequestBodyBytes`) through
`ingress.annotations`. The default path in this chart is an HTTPRoute, and the Gateway
API has no portable request-body limit — so on that path the process's own admission
gate is the only limit, which is why it exists. Rate-limiting the restore path at the
edge is worth doing for the same reason.

**Restores queue, and the queue is bounded.** The compressed upload budget cannot
bound decompressed memory — a small gzip expands to the expanded ceiling whatever
its wire size — so restore *processing* is capped separately, at one concurrent
restore on the default pod. A second restore waits rather than decompressing
beside the first, because the caller has already uploaded the artifact and a 503
would make them upload it again. `backend.restoreQueue` bounds that wait in both
directions: past `limit` waiters a request is refused with 503 and `Retry-After`
instead of joining the queue, and past `waitMs` a waiting request is refused the
same way. A caller who disconnects while queued is dropped, and its restore never
runs — the operation is destructive, so running it for somebody who left is worse
than refusing it. A disconnect *after* the slot is granted changes nothing: that
restore is part-way through replacing the user's data and runs to completion. The
startup log prints the slot count with both bounds beside it.

**The frontend does not need matching headroom.** Ordinary `/api/*` bodies are
buffered by the Next.js proxy only up to 11MB, and anything larger is refused.
The large-upload routes (`.mny` import, restore, attachments, AI queries) are
served by route handlers that stream the body to the backend without holding
it, so the frontend's default memory limit covers them.

Set `MNY_IMPORT_LIMIT_MB` on **both** deployments if you change it. The frontend
reads it to bound the streamed `.mny` import and restore uploads, and refuses a
larger body with 413.


#### Storage for data kept outside Postgres

The backend container runs with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, so it can only
write where a volume is mounted. Until this block existed the workload
rendered no volumes at all, which meant two features visible in the UI could not
work in the canonical chart -- and both failed at the point of use rather than at
install time, so the UI went on presenting them as configured:

- **Automatic backups** write to `/data/backups` under the default `local`
  store. Directory creation failed with EROFS, so a user's schedule reported
  errors forever and produced no files. (`BACKUP_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` with the
  `BACKUP_STORE_S3_*` variables keeps the artifacts in a bucket instead and
  needs no claim; see "Horizontal scaling" for why `multi` cares.)
- **`ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`** writes to `/data/attachments`. Same
  failure, for receipts and documents. (The default `database` provider keeps
  bytes in Postgres and is unaffected; so is `s3`.)

Changing that provider **relocates the attachments already stored**, so the
switch is an upgrade rather than a line in the release notes:

```yaml
backend:
  extraEnv:
    - name: ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER
      value: "s3"
    - name: ATTACHMENT_S3_BUCKET
      value: "my-monize-attachments"
    # ...the other ATTACHMENT_S3_* variables from .env.example
    # - name: ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_MIGRATE_ON_SWITCH
    #   value: "false"          # leave them where they are instead
  persistence:
    attachments:
      enabled: true             # keep this until the relocation has finished
```

The backend copies each attachment into the new backend, reads the copy back
and checks it against the size and checksum recorded for it, then deletes the
original -- starting on boot, then hourly at :50 until none are left, one
attachment at a time. Two consequences for an operator:

- **The backend being left has to stay configured and mounted until it
  finishes**, because each attachment is read through the backend its own row
  names. So keep `persistence.attachments.enabled: true` (or the S3
  credentials, in the other direction) until the log stops reporting
  `Attachment storage relocation`, and disable it after.
- **Attachments stay readable throughout** -- before, during and after -- from
  whichever backend currently holds each one. A backend the deployment can no
  longer reach is the one exception: the API answers `503` naming it (not `404`),
  and the in-app preview says the file is intact and cannot be served from here.
  The browser's own download of such a file still just fails, so the preview is
  where a user learns why.

`ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_MIGRATE_ON_SWITCH=false` turns the relocation off, which
is a decision to keep the old backend indefinitely; the backend says so in its
log once per boot. There is no chart parameter for either variable, for the
same reason `ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER` has none: the attachment settings
are passed through `backend.extraEnv`, and `.env.example` is where they are
documented in full.

Both are off by default, because enabling them creates a PersistentVolumeClaim
and a cluster with no default StorageClass would leave the pod `Pending`. Turning
one on without saying where the storage comes from fails at render time rather
than at run time.

```yaml
backend:
  persistence:
    backups:
      enabled: true
      size: 5Gi           # or: existingClaim: my-backup-claim
      storageClass: ""    # empty uses the cluster default
      accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
    attachments:
      enabled: true       # only needed with ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
      size: 10Gi
```

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `backend.persistence.backups.enabled` | Mount durable storage at `backupContainerDir` | `false` |
| `backend.persistence.backups.existingClaim` | Use an existing PVC instead of creating one | `""` |
| `backend.persistence.backups.size` | Size of the created claim | `5Gi` |
| `backend.persistence.backups.storageClass` | StorageClass (empty = cluster default) | `""` |
| `backend.persistence.attachments.*` | Same shape, for `/data/attachments` | disabled |
| `backend.backupContainerDir` | Mount path for backups | `/data/backups` |
| `backend.attachmentContainerDir` | Mount path for local attachments | `/data/attachments` |
| `backend.extraVolumes` / `extraVolumeMounts` | Anything else the pod needs | `[]` |

Notes on sizing and behaviour:

- Retention keeps 7 daily, 4 weekly and 6 monthly artifacts **per user** by
  default, and each is a gzipped dump of that user's whole dataset -- so size
  against the number of users, not the number of files.
- A backup that could not include every attachment is kept apart, as
  `monize-backup-partial-<date>`, so it can never take a complete artifact's
  retention slot. Those are bounded by the same daily count, counted separately,
  so a deployment whose attachment storage is failing can hold up to 7 more
  artifacts per user than the figures above until it is fixed.
- Each user's backups go in a server-computed subdirectory named by their user
  id. One user's retention can only ever reach their own artifacts.
- Backup destinations are confined to `BACKUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS` (defaulting to
  `BACKUP_CONTAINER_DIR`). If you mount a second volume through `extraVolumes`
  and want users to be able to select it, add it to that variable as well.
- The claims carry `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so `helm uninstall` does not
  delete a user's only off-database backups or their attachment bytes.
- `fsGroup` is set from `securityContext.runAsGroup` when either store is
  enabled: a freshly provisioned volume is root-owned on most CSI drivers, and
  without it the first write fails with EACCES.
- `/tmp` always gets an `emptyDir`. Node and the `.mny` import both need
  somewhere to spill, and nothing there needs to survive a restart.

### Horizontal scaling

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `cluster.mode` | `single` (one backend replica) or `multi` | `single` |
| `cluster.attachmentSharedVolume` | Assert every replica mounts the attachment dir | `false` |
| `cluster.backupSharedVolume` | Assert every replica mounts the backup dir (`local` store only) | `false` |

`cluster.mode` becomes `CLUSTER_MODE` in the backend's configmap. At `single`
the backend keeps rate-limit counters and cross-replica wake-ups in its own
process, which is correct for one replica and wrong for two; at `multi` both
live in PostgreSQL. Nothing else is added -- there is no second datastore to
run, back up or secure. `docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling.md` has the
design.

Two things the chart cannot verify, and the backend refuses to boot without:

1. **`backend.database.DATABASE_HOST` must reach a PostgreSQL session.** Each
   replica holds one `LISTEN` open, and a transaction-mode pooler (pgBouncer in
   its default mode) accepts the connection and then drops the subscription --
   so wake-ups never arrive and the application merely looks slow. A direct
   service (CNPG's `-rw`, a plain Service, a session-mode pooler) is what this
   needs. The boot check catches it and says so in one line.

2. **The storage assertions must be true, not merely set.** No process can see
   from inside its own mount namespace whether the directory under its mount
   point is the one another pod sees, so the operator states it. Setting
   `cluster.backupSharedVolume: true` while the claim is still `ReadWriteOnce`
   is a deployment that boots and then loses backups, which is why `NOTES.txt`
   prints the mismatch at install time.

   Each assertion is only asked for by the storage that needs it. The backup one
   applies to the default `local` store; setting
   `BACKUP_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` in `backend.extraEnv`, with
   `BACKUP_STORE_S3_BUCKET` and the rest, puts the artifacts in a bucket every
   replica reaches by construction, and the refusal lifts. That bucket must not
   be the off-machine destination's `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`: the off-machine copy
   exists to survive the loss of the store, so the backend refuses to start when
   the two resolve to one location (INV-BACKUP-007). Switching stores is
   forward-only -- nothing is migrated, and the previous recovery points stay on
   the old claim -- so keep it until the new store has a full retention window.

`helm/ci/multi-values.yaml` turns on every template the mode reaches --
Deployments above one replica, both budgets, the spread constraints, the
backend HPA, `CLUSTER_MODE` in the ConfigMap, both storage assertions -- and CI
renders it on every push so none of them can silently stop working. Read it for
the shape of each key, not as a recommendation: a real deployment picks among
these rather than enabling all of them, and the file says so at the top.

Three things the chart refuses to render, because Kubernetes accepts all three
and none of them reports an error where it goes wrong:

- more than one backend replica (or an autoscaler that could produce one) at
  `cluster.mode: single`, where the second replica enforces every rate limit a
  second time and hears none of the first one's wake-ups;
- a `topologySpreadConstraints` entry whose `labelSelector` matches no pod --
  which is not a weaker constraint but no constraint at all, satisfied by every
  placement including all replicas on one node. Select `app: monize-backend` or
  `app: monize-frontend`, the labels the pods actually carry;
- a `podDisruptionBudget` that permits no eviction (`minAvailable` equal to the
  replica count, or `maxUnavailable: 0`), which turns a brief interruption into
  a node drain that blocks until somebody deletes the budget by hand.

Two more things worth knowing before an upgrade:

- **A `ReadWriteOnce` claim changes the rollout to `Recreate`.** Surging means
  two pods at once and such a volume attaches to one node, so the new pod would
  sit `Pending` on a Multi-Attach error while `maxUnavailable: 0` forbids
  removing the old one. That is a stuck rollout ending in a manual pod delete;
  `Recreate` takes the same seconds of downtime at the moment you chose. Set
  `accessMode: ReadWriteMany` on every enabled `backend.persistence` store to
  keep the surging rollout -- including when you mount your own claim with
  `existingClaim`, since `accessMode` is how you tell the chart what that claim
  is.
- **Changing only a ConfigMap value still rolls the pods.** Both pod templates
  carry a `checksum/config` annotation over their ConfigMap, because `envFrom`
  is read once at container start: without it a `helm upgrade --set
  cluster.mode=multi` would report success and change nothing.

Raising `backend.replicas` while 2025-era MCP clients connect also needs
`mcp.stickySessions`; see "MCP sessions and more than one backend replica"
above.

#### Upgrading from a chart version that used StatefulSets

The backend and frontend workloads are `Deployment`s. They were `StatefulSet`s,
and **a StatefulSet cannot be converted in place** -- `helm upgrade` fails with
a message about an immutable field. Nothing about these pods was ever ordinal
(no per-pod identity, no per-pod claim, no ordered start); what the StatefulSet
cost was a slower rollout.

The one-time step, before the upgrade:

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset monize-backend monize-frontend \
  --namespace monize --cascade=orphan
```

`--cascade=orphan` leaves the running pods alone, so the service keeps
answering while the upgrade runs. **They are never adopted.** A ReplicaSet
adopts only pods matching its full selector, which includes the
`pod-template-hash` label it generates; a StatefulSet's pods do not carry one
and never will. So the orphans keep serving, keep their old image, and are
counted by nothing -- the Deployment brings up its own replicas beside them,
and `kubectl get pods` shows both generations.

Delete the orphans by name once the new pods are `Ready`:

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace monize
kubectl delete pod monize-backend-0 monize-frontend-0 --namespace monize
```

The ordinal names are the giveaway: a Deployment's pods are
`monize-backend-<replicaset>-<random>`, so anything still named
`monize-backend-<n>` is an orphan. Leaving one running is not harmless at
`cluster.mode: single` -- it is the second replica the mode is not built for.

The PersistentVolumeClaims are untouched by any of this: they are ordinary
claims the chart creates, not `volumeClaimTemplates`, and they carry
`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`.

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

RLS is an optional defense-in-depth layer that enforces per-user data isolation
in the database itself. It is **off by default**; the standard single-role setup
needs no changes here. See `docs/future-plans/row-level-security.md` (design) and
the runbook for the phased rollout.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `backend.rls.RLS_MODE` | `off` \| `shadow` \| `enforce` (rendered into the backend ConfigMap) | `off` |
| `backend.rls.DATABASE_APP_USER` | Name of the unprivileged runtime role (rendered into the ConfigMap) | `monize_app` |

`RLS_MODE` and `DATABASE_APP_USER` are non-secret and go in the
`env-vars-backend` ConfigMap. The role's password, `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD`, is a
**secret**: supply it the same way as `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, via `backend.extraEnvFrom`
(a `secretRef`) or `backend.extraEnv` (a `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`). Never put it
in `values.yaml`.

**CNPG `DatabaseRole` requirement.** On the CloudNativePG deployment the
database owner (`DATABASE_USER`) is not a superuser and has **no `CREATEROLE`**,
so the application cannot create the `monize_app` role at startup. Provision it
declaratively with the `DatabaseRole` CRD (CloudNativePG **1.30+**), which gives
the role its own object and reconciliation loop rather than nesting it in the
`Cluster` spec's older `managed.roles` stanza:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: DatabaseRole
metadata:
  name: monize-app
  namespace: monize
spec:
  cluster:
    name: home            # your CNPG Cluster name (matches DATABASE_HOST)
  name: monize_app        # must equal backend.rls.DATABASE_APP_USER
  ensure: present
  login: true
  # Leave superuser/bypassrls at their defaults (false): the runtime role must
  # NOT bypass RLS -- that is the whole point of the unprivileged role.
  passwordSecret:
    name: monize-app-role # a kubernetes.io/basic-auth Secret (username+password)
```

The referenced Secret (`kubernetes.io/basic-auth`, keys `username` +
`password`) also feeds `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` into the backend -- point
`backend.extraEnv` at its `password` key:

```yaml
backend:
  extraEnv:
    - name: DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: monize-app-role
          key: password
```

With the role provisioned this way, backend startup skips role creation and only
applies the role's DML grants (idempotently, on every boot).

> On CloudNativePG **older than 1.30** (no `DatabaseRole` CRD), fall back to the
> `Cluster` spec's `spec.managed.roles` stanza with the same
> `name`/`login`/`passwordSecret` fields.

## Security

All containers enforce the `restricted` Pod Security Standard:
- Run as non-root user (UID 1001)
- Read-only root filesystem
- All Linux capabilities dropped
- RuntimeDefault seccomp profile
- No privilege escalation

## Testing

```bash
# Lint the chart
helm lint ./helm

# Render templates without deploying
helm template monize ./helm -n monize

# Dry-run install
helm install monize ./helm -n monize --dry-run

# Test with Ingress instead of HTTPRoute
helm template monize ./helm -n monize \
  --set httpRoute.enabled=false \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.className=nginx
```
