# Run a Playwright command from e2e/ inside the official Playwright image.
#
# The image carries the browsers and every system library they need, so a CI
# shard no longer runs `playwright install-deps`: that step installs the
# libraries with apt from the runner's Ubuntu mirror, and when the mirror
# stalled the step hung until its 10-minute timeout -- 18 of 51 shard runs in
# the 25 CI runs before this change, every success under a minute, every
# failure the full 10 minutes. The image comes from one registry pull instead.
#
# The image is pinned by digest. A tag is a name its publisher (or whoever
# controls the registry account) can point at different content at any time; a
# digest names the content itself, so a pull either returns the image that was
# reviewed or fails. docs/container-images.md maps every pinned tag to its
# digest and says how to update one.
#
# Usage (from anywhere in the repository):
#   scripts/e2e-playwright.sh pull                  # fetch the image, with retries
#   scripts/e2e-playwright.sh <command...>          # run in e2e/, e.g.
#   scripts/e2e-playwright.sh npx playwright test --shard=1/4
#
# The container shares the host network, so BASE_URL / E2E_LB_URL point at the
# docker-compose.e2e.yml stack exactly as they did on the runner. Passed through
# when set: BASE_URL CI SHARD E2E_CLUSTER E2E_LB_URL.
set -euo pipefail

# The tag is informational -- Docker resolves the digest. Keep both in step
# with docs/container-images.md; the version must equal @playwright/test in
# e2e/package-lock.json (checked below).
